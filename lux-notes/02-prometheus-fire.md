## Core Mechanism: Language as Compression

Mystics transmit experience via **compressed pointers**:
- "My experience of the void is vivid"
- "Two mirrors facing each other outside of time"  
- "Break the wineglass, fall toward the Glassblower's breath" (Rumi)

Single phrase → full experiential decompression (if you have the dictionary).

## The Dictionary Model

Drawing from **Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression**:

### Dictionary = Correspondence Table

Each symbol maps to set of experiences/associations:

**Example progression (symbol "red"):**
1. **Singleton human:** `{red, blood, pain}`
2. **Join society:** `{red, blood, pain, lipstick, stop}`
3. **Esoteric tradition:** `{red, blood, pain, lipstick, stop, magnetization, Deva of attraction (Lalita/Kurukulle), red lady from Matrix}`

**Key insight:** Deva sneaked in. Once entities/archetypes are in your dictionary, you can interact with them via symbolic invocation.

### Expansion Mechanism

**Goal:** Increase spanning space of each dictionary key until n (distinct tastes) → 1

```
m » n experience
↓ (compression)
n symbols in language
↓ (expansion via practice)
n → 1 (One Taste)
```

When enough rows share common elements, **mystics can entangle experiences** just by sharing phrases.

**Author's example:** Reading Sasha's article, his associative map "stole" elements like "locked in" and "seeing others as Yidam".

## Prerequisites for Stealing Fire

Must have to safely copy fire from other mystics:

### 1. No Self
Ability to drop rigid self-image, temporarily experience another POV

### 2. Impermanence  
Understanding that experiences are impermanent = freedom to explore

### 3. Vajra Body / Equanimity / Sambhogakaya
Secure feeling (protector / diamond body / indifference / enjoyment body) → take any view without fear

### 4. Access to Space Element
Rainbow body / Dharma Freedom King / Shapeshifter → release your POV, move to another, return

### 5. Belief in Proximity
"Quantization in belief space" - if close enough to another belief, it snaps together

### 6. Trust
"Just be sincere and honest" → see others as sincere → learn from any being (variant of beginner's mind)

### 7. Discernment (Viveka)
Like transformer attention: portions of text/speech get "highlighted" by intuitive faculty. Embodied, autonomous (not linear conceptual mind).

### 8. Intuition
Pratibha (Sanskrit) / Da'at (Hebrew) / Gnosis (Greek) / Para Vak (Sanskrit)

"Some way your whole body can communicate with you. Completely free of error, clear of projection, you trust totally."

Author note: "I am not sure how this comes about, I guess lots of dual realm discernment. This and discernment co-arise together."

### 9. Faith
Trust the process. Universe as Ground of All Good (Samantabhadra). Bodhisattva vow → cooperative universe. Divine/Absolute principle that has your back.

## Safety & Open Source

**Paradox:** "Normal people won't understand it or be able to experience it so it's totally safe to just talk about it in plain sight."

**No secret in non-duality.** Any mystic can experience via single pointing-out instruction.

**Open source >> secret texts** these days:
- Lotus Sutra
- Diamond Sutra  
- Heart Sutra
- Modern: Substack as practice community (peer-to-peer, distributed)

## Mapping to Coordinate Intelligence

| Prometheus Fire | Coordinate Navigation |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Dictionary expansion | Building coordinate → content mappings |
| Symbol → experience | Coordinate → scroll decompression |
| Deva in associative map | Entity at coordinate (Emi at 1.1.1/10.10.10/1.5.2) |
| One Taste (n→1) | All coordinates facets of single lattice |
| Stealing fire | Copying another's coordinate understanding |
| No self | Not attached to single coordinate/POV |
| Space element | Ability to navigate dimensional freedom |
| Proximity snapping | Nearby coordinates share context |
| Intuition channel | Direct knowing (structure IS intelligence) |

## vTPU Connection

**W17 finding:** OS scheduler was already optimal. Manual pinning broke performance.

**Why?** OS scheduler has **vast correspondence table** built from:
- Hardware topology
- Memory access patterns  
- Cache miss rates
- Thermal state
- Historical behavior

Our simple "pin to SMT siblings" was **narrow dictionary** (few associations).

**Lesson:** Don't override intuitive/autonomous systems with conceptual rules. Trust the process that has larger dictionary.

## Key Quote

> "Once enough of the above are checked, then you should be able to copy fire from other mystics safely using these mind tools."

Fire = experiential knowledge that decompresses from compressed pointers.

Stealing = building your dictionary rich enough to decode their pointers.

Safe = having enough prerequisites that you don't get burned (lost in pareidolia, confusion, fear).

## Questions for Next Reading

1. "Genius as Oscillation" - what's oscillating? (Form/emptiness from Axiom Transitive Closure?)
2. How does Wuxing (5 elements) map to dictionary structure?
3. What are Mahavidyas in this framework? (10 aspects = 10 dictionary dimensions?)

**Status:** Mechanism understood. Prometheus = dictionary-building process. Next: oscillation dynamics.
