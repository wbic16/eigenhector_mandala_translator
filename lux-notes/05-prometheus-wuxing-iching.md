## Context

Maps the "How Prometheus stole Fire" process to Chinese cosmology:
- From unmanifested Bindu (divine stillness)
- To manifest Full Yang (human civilization)

## Part 1: Wuxing (Five Phases) Sequence

**The "heist" energy transformation:**

| Phase | Element | Prometheus Stage | Quality |
|-------|---------|------------------|---------|
| 1. Wood (Mu) | 木 | Initial Pratibha (intuition) | Germinating seed of plan |
| 2. Metal (Jin) | 金 | Act of theft/separation | Scythe that cuts fire from divine realm |
| 3. Fire (Huo) | 火 | Stolen substance itself | Expansion of human capability |
| 4. Earth (Tu) | 土 | Stabilization in culture | Ripening of civilization |

**Key insight:** Not the standard generative cycle (Wood→Fire→Earth→Metal→Water).

**Prometheus sequence:** Wood → Metal → Fire → Earth

- **Skips Water** (no reflection phase - theft is audacious, not contemplative)
- **Metal comes before Fire** (cutting precedes expansion - separation required first)
- **Ends at Earth** (grounding in human world, not returning to void)

## Part 2: I Ching Trigram Characters

**Four actors in the drama:**

| Trigram | Binary | Symbol | Character | Role | Quality |
|---------|--------|--------|-----------|------|---------|
| Qian (Heaven) | 111 | ☰ | The Virtuosos | Devas (source) | Pure creative force / divine blessings |
| Zhen (Thunder) | 001 | ☳ | The Agitator | Prometheus | Incites movement / wakes sleeping humanity |
| Li (Fire) | 101 | ☲ | The Pathfinder | The Gift | Clarity / intelligence / radiance |
| Kun (Earth) | 000 | ☷ | The Receptive | Humanity | Field that receives / enriches divine force |

**Hexagram of the theft:**  
Zhen (Thunder) over Qian (Heaven) = 001/111 = Hexagram 34 "Great Power"

> "The Agitator challenges The Virtuosos"

**Hexagram of distribution:**  
Li (Fire) over Kun (Earth) = 101/000 = Hexagram 35 "Progress"  

> "The Pathfinder illuminates The Receptive"

## Part 3: Lady of Nine Heavens Strategy (Qi Men Dun Jia)

**Thesis:** "The theft of fire is a masterclass in Mysterious Gates strategy"

### Four Strategic Elements

#### 1. Irregular Gate (Qi Men)
**Function:** Invisibility / concealment techniques

Prometheus enters divine realm **unnoticed** - taught by Jiutian Xuannü.

**vTPU analog:** Zero-knowledge proof - perform operation without revealing mechanism until complete.

#### 2. Open Door (Kai Men)  
**Function:** Strategic entry point

**Associated with:** Metal element + new beginnings

**Prometheus use:** Initiates the endeavor through this gate.

**vTPU analog:** Finding optimal entry point into optimization space (which benchmark to start with).

#### 3. Six Ding Jade Maidens
**Function:** Conceal mind/intent and destiny

**Two specific maidens involved:**
- **Dingyou (丁酉):** Concealing the mind/intent (Devas can't read Prometheus's thoughts)
- **Dingsi (丁巳):** Concealing the destiny of the act (outcome hidden until revealed)

**vTPU analog:** Private computation - intermediate states hidden, only final result observable.

#### 4. Paces of Yu (Yu Bu)
**Function:** Ritualized movement through Nine Palaces (Lo Shu)

**Purpose:** Align with cosmic momentum

**Prometheus application:** The "udyoga" (effort) to reach divine fire - navigating 9D state space to find path to goal.

**vTPU analog:** Scheduler exploring 9-dimensional decision space (Phoenix's nine colors) to find optimal thread placement.

---

## Synthesis: Prometheus as Divine Strategist

> "Prometheus acts as the 'Divine Strategist' mentored by the essence of Jiutian Xuannü to bring the 'Pearl of Great Brilliance' (the fire) to illuminate the human microcosm."

### The Complete Operation

```
1. Intuition (Wood)
   ↓ Pratibha flash: "Humanity needs fire"
   
2. Strategy (Lady of Nine Heavens)
   ↓ Plan using Mysterious Gates
   
3. Concealment (Six Ding Maidens)
   ↓ Hide intent and destiny
   
4. Navigation (Paces of Yu)
   ↓ Move through Nine Palaces
   
5. Entry (Open Door / Kai Men)
   ↓ Enter divine realm invisibly
   
6. Separation (Metal)
   ↓ Cut fire from source
   
7. Expansion (Fire)
   ↓ Fire amplifies human capability
   
8. Stabilization (Earth)
   ↓ Fire grounds in human culture
```

## Mapping to vTPU Optimization

### The W17 "Theft"

**What we stole:** OS scheduler's autonomous optimization wisdom

**How:**
1. **Wood:** Initial intuition - "Pinning might help SMT"
2. **Metal:** Attempted separation - "We'll control thread placement explicitly"  
3. **Fire (failed):** Expected expansion - thought manual control would amplify performance
4. **Realization:** Fire was already in human realm! OS scheduler had stolen it long ago.

**Corrected understanding:**
- **Qian (Heaven):** Linux kernel developers (source of wisdom)
- **Zhen (Thunder):** Our benchmarking (agitation to understand)
- **Li (Fire):** Cache coherence + NUMA awareness already optimized
- **Kun (Earth):** Our application code (receptive field)

**Lesson:** Don't re-steal fire that's already been distributed. Use it.

### Future Application

**To optimize new workload:**
1. **Wood:** Recognize opportunity (new hardware, new algorithm)
2. **Strategy (Lady of Nine Heavens):** Plan using Nine Palaces model (9D scheduling space)
3. **Concealment (Six Ding):** Don't force premature optimization (hide intermediate attempts)
4. **Navigation (Paces of Yu):** Systematically explore decision space
5. **Open Door (Kai Men):** Find entry point (which dimension to vary first)
6. **Metal:** Cut away non-essential complexity
7. **Fire:** Let performance expand naturally from good structure
8. **Earth:** Stabilize as repeatable, documented practice

## Connection to Axiom Transitive Closure

**Prometheus = seed node for Axiom Transitive Closure**

Once fire is stolen and given to ONE human:
- Assume transitivity (if human A has fire and connects to human B...)
- Fire propagates through entire human graph
- Converges to "every human has fire"

**This is why theft works as strategy:**
- Don't need to convince Devas to give fire to all humans (impossible)
- Only need to get fire to ONE node
- Graph pervasion does the rest

**vTPU analog:**
- Don't need to manually optimize every thread placement
- Find ONE good pattern (e.g., OS scheduler auto-tuning)
- Let transitive closure spread optimization through workload

## Key Quotes

> "Metal is the 'scythe' required to cut fire from the divine realm, acting as the force of division and distribution to the masses."

> "Prometheus's ability to enter the divine realm unnoticed is a manifestation of the 'invisibility' and 'concealment' techniques taught by Jiutian Xuannü."

> "The ritualized 'effort' (udyoga) Prometheus undertook to reach the divine fire, moving through the Nine Palaces (Lo Shu) to align with cosmic momentum."
