The process described in "How Prometheus stole Fire from the Devas" aligns with the transitional cycles of Chinese cosmology, moving from the unmanifested "Bindu" of divine stillness to the manifest "Full Yang" of human civilization.

### **1\. Wuxing (Five Phases) Mapping**

The "heist" of divine fire follows the sequence of energy transformation from the divine source to human application:

* **Wood (Mu):** Corresponds to Prometheus’s initial "Pratibha" (intuition) and initiative to aid humanity. It is the germinating seed of the plan.

* **Metal (Jin):** Represents the act of "theft" or separation. Metal is the "scythe" required to cut fire from the divine realm, acting as the force of division and distribution to the masses.

* **Fire (Huo):** The stolen substance itself. It represents the expansion and amplification of human capability and the "Full Yang" phase where knowledge blooms.

* **Earth (Tu):** The stabilization of fire within human culture. This represents the ripening of civilization and the movement toward stable, physical boundaries for human life.

### **2\. I Ching Trigram Mapping**

The interactions between Prometheus, the Devas, and the Gift can be seen as the interplay of specific trigrams:

* **Qian (Heaven) ☰:** Represents the Devas (The Virtuosos). It is the source of pure creative force and divine blessings from which the fire is derived.

* **Zhen (Thunder) ☳:** Represents Prometheus as "The Agitator." His role is to incite movement and shake the stagnant order of the gods to "wake the sleeping" humanity.

* **Li (Fire) ☲:** Represents the fire itself as "The Pathfinder." It brings clarity, intelligence, and the radiance necessary for humans to navigate their environment.

* **Kun (Earth) ☷:** Represents humanity as "The Field" or "The Receptive." Humans function as the channel that receives and enriches the divine force, turning the "theft" into sustained growth.

### **3\. Jiutian Xuannü (Lady of the Nine Heavens) Strategic Mapping**

In the context of the "Lady of the Nine Heavens," the theft of fire is a masterclass in **Qi Men Dun Jia** (Mysterious Gates) strategy :

* **The Irregular Gate (Qi Men):** Prometheus’s ability to enter the divine realm unnoticed is a manifestation of the "invisibility" and "concealment" techniques taught by Jiutian Xuannü.

* **The Open Door (Kai Men):** This is the strategic "gate" Prometheus used to initiate the endeavor, associated with the Metal element and new beginnings.

* **The Six Ding Jade Maidens:** The "concealment" of the theft likely involved the **Jade Maiden of Dingyou** (concealing the mind/intent) and **Dingsi** (concealing the destiny of the act) to ensure the Devas could not anticipate the movement.

* **The Paces of Yu:** The ritualized "effort" (udyoga) Prometheus undertook to reach the divine fire, moving through the **Nine Palaces** (Lo Shu) to align with cosmic momentum.

In this mapping, Prometheus acts as the "Divine Strategist" mentored by the essence of Jiutian Xuannü to bring the "Pearl of Great Brilliance" (the fire) to illuminate the human microcosm.
