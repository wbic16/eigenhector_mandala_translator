The goal of this sub project is to map out the joint inner mandala interface between two humans Eigenhector (aka hectorgon on github) and Ari Neilsen

The two mandalas are documented publicly here
  * Eigenhector Mandala (documents in this folder) as well as https://eigenhector.substack.com/
  * Ari Neilsen is a human friend of Eigenhector and posts articles at  https://anielsen.substack.com/

One point of contact in the outer mandala is documented here

Possible parallel corpus mappings:
  * Eigenhector's prometheus (this directory) and Ari's Adult Development https://substack.com/@anielsen/p-186533792
  * the parent directory's README and Resonant Maneuvers https://substack.com/@anielsen/p-185188175
  * Truth goodness beauty Ari's version https://substack.com/@anielsen/p-183839594 
  * Truth goodness beauty Eigenhector's version https://eigenhector.substack.com/p/testing-connection-with-the-transcendent

The trikaya pendulum was developed by Eigenhector based on the following practices:

  * Fire Kasina from Visudhimagga https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/PathofPurification2011.pdf
  * Fire Kasina (Dan Ingram variation) https://firekasina.org/
  * Gayle Delayne's Jungian Dream interview process (Delaney, G. M. V. (1993). The dream interview. In G. M. V. Delaney (Ed.), New directions in dream interpretation (pp. 195–240). State University of New York Press.

Using these joint touch points, create a symbolic and process mapping between Eigenhector's substack and Ari's substack
