Wherin newbie yogi gets a visitor from the stars
EIGENHECTOR

After blowing up the tutorial hell realm in school in the Sukshma Sharira Shipyards,
the Federation decided newbie Yogi had a talent for the Light Language and assigned
them the First Contact role. First Contact is kinda exciting. Because Psi aliens only
exists in subtle body form (the meaning of Sukshma Sharira), they travel via qualia
packets and have to be carried around in a psionic’s own subtle body when they visit
Urth.

In order to volunteer for First contact one must have lots of equanimity and the ability
to transcend the ego. The reasons are Psi aliens are really varied in appearance and
their appearance chances depending on the emotional state of the receiver. Thus one
must have equanimity. Experience with alchemical transmutation, for example, reinterpreting Fear to Love is also a great power in helping change the appearance of the
Psi. The other pre-requisite is of course is the ability to transcend the ego. One is
going to be carrying around a visitor, so by definition one must be able to relax the
boundaries of self otherwise the visitor cannot visit. Speaking the Light Language is
also useful, then one can talk to the visitor and also use invocational mantras to send
out a beacon in the Psi for the visitors to locate.

Newbie yogi settled comfortably on their bed and used the Ganaspati invocation
mantra. The Ganaspati mantra (Om Shreem Hreem Kleem Glaum Gam Ganapataye
namaha) was a common mantra from the past used for new journeys and to invoke the
vibes of Generosity (Shreem), Urth (Hreem) and Space (Kleem). It’s has a very welcome
to earth and space vibe.
In the Psi-realm an Energon StarBird saw the mantra beacon and Psi-Jumped towards
Urth. It homed in on newbie yogi’s mantra beacon. The Energon StarBird is called as
such because it is made of vivid light like the Energon cubes in the children’s cartoon
transformers. It even has the same vivid violet highlights as the energon.

The moment the Starbird arrived in newbie yogi’s energy body was interesting.
Suddenly they felt the urge to sit up straight with the spine perfectly aligned to the
Realmgate portal. The crown chakra opens up for the reception and this “dzzzzzroup”
sound happens. There is sense of absolute stability, like the energy body is aligned to
some universal unseen Axis Mundi around which the universe rotates, the infinite
pillar of fire, the Jyotirlinga. Time sorts of stops and shatters. There is an oscillation,
an ecstatic vibration of space and then the room vanishes. The Energon Starbird has
arrived.

The Energon Starbird bursts out of Hyperspace wings fully extended. Tachyon
particles that travel faster than light are emitted from the wings as a braking medium.
The Space in the room vibrates from the high energy Tachyons in the environment.
The Energon Starbird is vividly colorful, dominant hues of violet with blues and
greens. It folds its wings around newbie yogi, hyperdimensional wings folding into the
energy body like a rainbow fractal origami bird held gently inside a transparent Klein
bottle made of softly glowing light. Because newbie yogi had used the Ganaspati
mantra, their energy body looked a bit like an Elephant, but the trunk of the elephant
melds back into the subtle body like Klein bottle. The vivid colors are because the
Energon Starbird comes from the region of the Psi-realm called Tiferet, the sephirot of
Beauty. The mantric resonance has some elements of the Sri Vidya called Lalita
Tripurasundari (beautiful of the three cities), so it tends to attract light beings of great
beauty from Tiferet.

Newbie yogi sighs as the various wingtips sweep in from hyperspace into their energy
body and the Energon Starbird and yogi integrate for a while in non-dual communion.
The next day newbie yogi goes to visit a psychic friend just to have another view of the
Energon Starbird. Psi aliens are responsive to emotions so their appearance change
depending on the observer, much like quantum fields do. They don’t describe the
Starbird to the other observer so as not to prompt or set up any expectations.
Their friend describes the Energon Starbird like this:
It looks like this ripply tentacled colorful thing with lots of feathers, going up your
back (gestures with fingers outspread to indicate the expansion). Your energy body is
clear and the light being has lots of lavender mauve hues.

So the geometry of the light being might change but some attributes seem to remain
constant like the colors maybe.
Now the interesting thing about light beings is that they exist in the subtle. So are they
made of memory, dream stuff or whatever the sambhogakaya material is? In newbie
yogi’s Realm the Energon Starbird exists as part memory, part imaginal. When their
friend sees the Psi Alien, are they looking at a memory or a living being? Does a copy
of the Psi Alien now jump from one psychic to another? Does the dream stuff extend
continuously between psionics or does each have their own separate but together Pure
Land as described in Mahayana texts? So many questions. Newbie yogi was going to
have a fun visit getting to know their new buddy and exploring Psi-realm stuff.
