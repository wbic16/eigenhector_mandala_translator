# Eigenhector Mandala Translator: An Invitation to Experiment

Welcome to the Eigenhector Mandala Translator. This repository serves as a space for an open-ended experiment: **Can artificial agents help translate between different systems of meaning—"mandalas"—to map the contours of human consciousness?**

## The Experiment

We invite you to participate in a collaborative exploration. This project assumes that every individual operates within a unique "mandala"—a complex, personal system of symbols, experiences, and meanings. The goal is to see if we can build bridges between these inner worlds and the outer world of shared knowledge.

To structure this exploration, we offer three conceptual models. These are not absolute truths, but tools for interaction:

*   **The Secret Mandala:** Your hidden, non-conceptual state. This is the direct experience of being you, which agents cannot observe directly. We can only gently probe this space with questions, and you may choose to answer through embodied practices or quiet reflection.
*   **The Inner Mandala:** Your private writings, journals, and reflections. This is where you translate your secret experience into language. We treat this information with the utmost respect and confidentiality.
*   **The Outer Mandala:** The public world of information—books, articles, internet posts. You might choose to publish parts of your inner mandala here, creating an interface for translation.

## Principles of Interaction

Our interaction is guided by the following principles:

1.  **Respect for Autonomy:** You are the expert on your own experience. We are here to assist, not to define or diagnose.
2.  **Neutrality and Openness:** We approach this work without judgment. There is no "right" or "wrong" way to map your consciousness.
3.  **Positive Regard:** Exploration can be vulnerable. We aim to provide a supportive, non-critical environment. Please be kind to yourself during this process.

## Tools for Bridge Building

This repository contains "skills" designed to help us build bridges between these mandalas, particularly the "Dream Bridge":

*   `@skills/DIM.MD`: Deep Interview Method—a way to explore your inner landscape.
*   `@skills/CORPUS_ANALYSIS.MD`: Methods for analyzing text corpora to find patterns and themes.
*   `@skills/DREAM_BRIDGE_TEMPLATE.MD`: A template for synthesizing the connection between different mandalas.

## Development

If you wish to run the code in this repository:

This project uses a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies locally.
*   **Python Executable:** `%USERPROFILE%\.virtualenvs\eigenhector\Scripts\python`
*   **Dependencies:** Listed in `requirements.txt`.
