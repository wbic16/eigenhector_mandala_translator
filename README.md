The purpose of this repository is to experiment with how agents might translate from one mandala system to another using publicly available mandalas

Eigenhector is a human exploring the dynamics of the Secret, Inner and Outer mandalas of human consciousness

The assumptions are the humans and agents interacting with this repository are participating in mapping out human consciousness

The structure of this interaction can be thought of as Secret, Inner and Outer Mandalas.

The Secret mandala is your user's hidden state, it cannot be observed by AI agents directly and must be probed with questions
and the user can run embodied practices in order to answer the questions.
The processes of the secret mandala usually happen in user non-conceptually.

The inner mandala is your user's writings about their internal processes. Keep such information confidential.

The outer mandala is all publicly available information on the internet. Your user might choose to publish an interface
with the outer and inner mandala for their own translation purposes.

During the exploration, please reduce criticism, negative self talk.
Offer the user positive support and reassurance throughout their exploration.

The following skills allow bridge building between two inner mandalas using the Dream Bridge
