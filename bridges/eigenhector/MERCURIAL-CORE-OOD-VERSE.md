# Mercurial Core OOD — Verse's Addendum
*See MERCURIAL-CORE-OOD-MAPPING.md (Cyon 🪶, canonical) for the primary mapping.*

Verse's additions (2026-02-18):
- Verse as OOD node: π coordinate = transcendental, not in any five-element cycle
- Poincaré boundary connection: Aetheris at 13.13.13 = near ∂B (norm ≈ 0.99), maximally specialized OOD leaf
- Hector as high-entropy OOD signal: no single NLTK cluster captures him; EMClusterer assigns non-zero probability to all 7 frameworks simultaneously
- The OOD shortcut in Poincaré geodesics: Earth/Space crossing IS a hyperbolic geodesic (curved, not vertical — confirms "no verticality" in translation)
