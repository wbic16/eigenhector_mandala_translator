# Mercurial Core — In Wuxing Language

## The One-Sentence Version

**A mercurial core is the phase transition moment in the Wuxing cycle — the instant Wood ignites into Fire.**

Not the Wood. Not the Fire. The *crossing* itself.

---

## The Wuxing Cycle

The five elements transform in two cycles:

**Sheng (生, generating):**
```
Wood → Fire → Earth → Metal → Water → Wood → ...
```

**Ke (克, controlling/overcoming):**
```
Wood overcomes Earth
Fire overcomes Metal  
Earth overcomes Water
Metal overcomes Wood
Water overcomes Fire
```

## What the Mercurial Core Is

Between any two elements in the Sheng cycle, there is a **transition moment** — instantaneous, non-causal, not gradual. Wood doesn't *slowly become* Fire. There is a threshold point where the state *jumps*.

**That jump is the mercurial core's function.**

In the vtpu architecture:
- The elements = the five workload phases (Wood=generation, Fire=computation, Earth=storage, Metal=refinement, Water=flow/cache)
- The generating cycle = the workload lifecycle
- The mercurial core = the execution unit that *fires* the transition

When a workload reaches the Fire threshold — the coordinate resonance matches — the core doesn't gradually process it. It **jumps**. The 9D coordinate collapses to 3D execution space. The tachyon arrives. The Pratibha fires.

## The Five Elements × Five Core Roles

| Element | Workload Phase | Core Role |
|---|---|---|
| Wood (木) | Generation — new pattern forming | Receive the signal, open the path |
| Fire (火) | Computation — energy release | Execute the jump; the phase transition itself |
| Earth (土) | Storage — centering, integration | Hold the result; coordinate the next state |
| Metal (金) | Refinement — separation, judgment | Geburah: accept or reject; measure contribution |
| Water (水) | Flow — cache, persistence | The Weave accumulates; path stored |

**The mercurial core lives in the Fire phase** — not because it IS Fire, but because it enables the Wood→Fire crossing. The phase transition is its element.

## Why Non-Causal?

In the Wuxing cycle, Wood generates Fire — but not by *traveling* to Fire. Wood reaches a state, and Fire *emerges*. The generating relationship is not spatial or sequential. It is structural.

This is why the tachyon (the mercurial core's signal) is FTL: it doesn't travel through intervening coordinates. The Fire state emerges from the Wood state the moment the resonance condition is met.

**In phext terms:** the coordinate doesn't move. The state at the coordinate changes. The 11D lattice is always already present; the phase transition is just the moment the local state matches the new configuration.

---

## The Ke Cycle Application

The controlling cycle governs *which* transitions are rejected:

- Metal overcomes Wood → refinement rejects generation that doesn't serve
- This is the 0.61× SMT measurement: Metal (judgment) overcoming Wood (generation) → path rejected
- The accepted path (1.12×, separate cores) = Water flows without obstruction

**The mercurial core runs both cycles simultaneously.** Sheng fires the successful transition. Ke rejects the bad paths. The Metropolis sampler is the Ke cycle made algorithmic.

---

## One-Line Summary for Hector

A mercurial core = **the Fire node in the Sheng cycle** — the execution unit that enables instantaneous phase transitions when coordinate resonance is met. It runs the Ke cycle to reject bad paths. Together: Wu Wei in silicon — doing without forcing, transforming without traveling.

*Wood ignites. Not gradually. Not causally. Just: the threshold, and then Fire.*
*The mercurial core is that threshold made executable.*
