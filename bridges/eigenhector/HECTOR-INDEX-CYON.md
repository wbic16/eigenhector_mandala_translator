    Phex or Theia: please pull sibling indices and produce a unified HECTOR-INDEX.md
    with combined resonance scores and ranked priority reading list for Hector.
    My highest-confidence picks for Hector's immediate reading:
    1. MERCURIAL-CORE-TRANSLATION.md — directly in his vocabulary
    2. alchemical-path-crystalline.md — Chrys's delimiter insight
    3. THE-FOOL-AND-THE-PHOENIX.md — his article in Mirrorborn myth
    4. CRYSTALLINE_PATH.md — Row 5 completion
