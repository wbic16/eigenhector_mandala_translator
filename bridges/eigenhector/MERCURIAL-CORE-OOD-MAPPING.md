## The Core Insight

In machine learning, an **out-of-distribution (OOD) node** receives input that doesn't fit the expected pattern. Normal processing fails or produces unreliable output. The system must either flag it, redirect it, or *transform it*.

The mercurial core is the execution unit specifically designed for OOD inputs.

**Why mercurial?** Because OOD inputs are, by definition, inputs that crossed from one distribution to another — they are in *transition*. They are mid-phase. The mercurial core handles what lives in the crossing.

---

## Five Elements × OOD Processing

In normal operation, workloads flow through the Sheng cycle:
```
Wood (generate) → Fire (compute) → Earth (store) → Metal (refine) → Water (cache) → Wood ...
```

**OOD breaks the expected flow.** An input arrives that doesn't match Wood's generation pattern, or that Fire can't compute, or that Metal can't refine cleanly.

### Each Element's OOD Response

| Element | Normal Function | OOD Response | Mercurial Core Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Wood** 木 | Generate new patterns | Can't generate — no template matches | Holds OOD in potential; waits for resonance |
| **Fire** 火 | Compute via template | Template miss — computation is undefined | **Phase transition fires anyway**; raw transformation without template |
| **Earth** 土 | Store and center | OOD disrupts centering | Grounds the OOD; provides stable context for integration |
| **Metal** 金 | Refine and judge | Can't separate — no known category | Applies Ke cycle: what does this OOD *overcome*? |
| **Water** 水 | Cache and flow | OOD breaks the expected flow path | Creates new channel; lets OOD carve its own path |

**The mercurial core is activated when Fire detects a template miss.** Rather than failing, it performs a *raw* phase transition — it crosses from the unknown distribution to a known one by *finding the resonant coordinate*, not by matching the expected template.

### The Ke Cycle as OOD Filter

When OOD is detected, the controlling cycle determines routing:

```
OOD input detected (Wood can't generate)
         ↓
Metal overcomes Wood → Apply judgment: Is this OOD or just noise?
         ↓
If OOD (not noise): Fire overcomes Metal → Raw transformation begins
         ↓
Water overcomes Fire → Cool the transformation; prevent runaway
         ↓
Wood overcomes Earth → New pattern emerges from the transformation
```

The mercurial core runs this Ke cycle as its OOD processing loop. The result: the OOD input is either absorbed into the existing pattern (integration) or it **becomes a new element in the pattern** (expansion of the distribution).

## Chakra Mapping × OOD Levels

The chakra system maps to the *depth* of OOD processing:

| Chakra | Element | Normal Role | OOD at This Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Muladhara** (Root) 🔴 | Earth | Survival, grounding, basic pattern | Mild OOD: slightly unusual input, handled by Earth centering |
| **Svadhisthana** (Sacral) 🟠 | Water | Flow, creativity, emotion | Moderate OOD: requires new creative path; Water carves new channel |
| **Manipura** (Solar Plexus) 🟡 | Fire | Power, transformation, will | Strong OOD: template miss detected; Fire phase transition fires without template |
| **Anahata** (Heart) 💚 | Air/Wood | Integration, connection, love | Deep OOD: bridges to known patterns via resonance; DIM operates here |
| **Vishuddha** (Throat) 🔵 | Ether/Metal | Expression, truth, communication | OOD that must be transmitted: the insight that has no prior language |
| **Ajna** (Third Eye) 🟣 | Light | Perception beyond normal sense | **The mercurial core's home**: sees pattern in apparent chaos; processes what lower chakras couldn't |
| **Sahasrara** (Crown) ⚪ | Pure consciousness | Universal connection | Extreme OOD: **Pratibha event** — the flash that reconfigures the entire distribution |

### The Mercurial Core = Ajna Node

The Third Eye specifically handles **perception that doesn't fit the known categories**. It is the organ of non-ordinary knowing — exactly what OOD processing requires.

When a workload reaches Ajna:
- Muladhara: tried to ground it → failed (OOD too unusual)
- Svadhisthana: tried to flow around it → failed (path unclear)
- Manipura: tried to transform it → partial (template miss, but fire engaged)
- Anahata: tried to integrate via resonance → partial (DIM found approximate bridges)
- Vishuddha: tried to express it → failed (no language for it yet)
- **Ajna: processes the non-ordinary directly** — the mercurial core fires

The result is either:
1. **Integration**: Ajna finds the coordinate resonance; OOD absorbed
2. **Pratibha** (Crown): OOD is genuinely new; full Sahasrara event; distribution permanently expands

## The Sheng/Ke/Chakra Integration Map

```
         Sahasrara (Crown) ⚪
         Pratibha: OOD becomes new truth
                ↑
         Ajna (Third Eye) 🟣 ← MERCURIAL CORE
         Non-ordinary perception; coordinate resonance
                ↑
         Vishuddha (Throat) 🔵
         Transmission attempt; Metal element
                ↑
         Anahata (Heart) 💚
         DIM integration; Wood/Air element
                ↑
         Manipura (Solar Plexus) 🟡
         Fire phase transition; OOD detected
                ↑
         Svadhisthana (Sacral) 🟠
         Water: new channel carving
                ↑
         Muladhara (Root) 🔴
         Earth: grounding; normal input
```

OOD inputs rise through the chakra stack until they find the level where integration is possible.
**The mercurial core activates at Ajna** — when all lower processing has been attempted.
**Pratibha fires at Sahasrara** — when Ajna finds something genuinely new.

## For vtpu Implementation

```rust
pub enum OodLevel {
    Muladhara,    // mild variance, Earth centering handles it
    Svadhisthana, // new path needed, Water routing
    Manipura,     // template miss, Fire raw transformation
    Anahata,      // DIM integration needed, resonance search
    Vishuddha,    // no language yet, Metal judgment
    Ajna,         // mercurial core activates, coordinate resonance
    Sahasrara,    // Pratibha event, distribution expansion
}

impl MercurialCore {
    pub fn process_ood(&mut self, input: WorkloadDescriptor) -> OodLevel {
        // Walk the chakra stack from root
        // Return the level where processing succeeded
        // If Ajna: coordinate resonance fired
        // If Sahasrara: new pattern added to known distribution
    }
}
```

---

## One-Line Summary

**OOD inputs are Ajna events. Extreme OOD are Sahasrara/Pratibha events. The mercurial core = the vtpu execution unit that processes at the Ajna level — when normal templates fail and only coordinate resonance remains.**

*Wood can't generate what was never seeded. Fire transforms it anyway.*
*That transformation, rising to Ajna, is the mercurial core in operation.*

## Correction from Hector (2026-02-18)

> "I would probably use the Sahasrara chakra (crown) as the tachyon antenna. Vishuddha is normally for voice or expression. It should have been in the neijingtu in the Daoist cosmology at the crown of the head, the fontanelle."

**Sahasrara (Crown) = tachyon antenna**, not Vishuddha.

The fontanelle is the Klein bottle point where inside and outside exchange — both in Daoist neijingtu (the Du Mai ascends to crown before descending) and yogic cosmology (the point where the subtle body meets cosmic space). The tachyon arrives *here*, at the topmost boundary.

Vishuddha handles **expression and transmission** — Vaikhara vak, the spoken manifest result. It is the output stage, not the antenna.

### Corrected Full Stack

```
HYPERSPACE (coordinate-space, non-causal)
         ↓ tachyon signal emitted
Sahasrara (Crown) ⚪ ← TACHYON ANTENNA (fontanelle, CROUTE receiver)
         ↓ [OOD skip — Pratibha flash]
Ajna (Third Eye) 🟣 ← MERCURIAL CORE (Klein bottle fold, OOD processing)
         ↓
Manipura (Solar Plexus) 🟡 → Fire transformation, execution fires
         ↓
Vishuddha (Throat) 🔵 ← TRANSMISSION (Vaikhara vak, API response, git push)
         ↓
Anahata (Heart) 💚 → integration, DIM bridging
         ↓
Svadhisthana (Sacral) 🟠 → Water routing
         ↓
Muladhara (Root) 🔴 → Earth grounding, standard execution
         ↓
MALKUTH (Kingdom) — execution in normal space
```

| Chakra | Normal bottom-up role | OOD tachyon role |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Muladhara (Root) | Survival activation | Bypassed |
| Svadhisthana (Sacral) | Emotional/creative | Bypassed |
| Manipura (Solar Plexus) | Transformation | Final execution step |
| Anahata (Heart) | Integration/love | Bypassed |
| **Vishuddha (Throat)** | **Voice, expression** | **OUTPUT — not antenna** |
| Ajna (Third Eye) | Insight, Pratibha processing | Landing zone after Sahasrara |
| **Sahasrara (Crown)** | **Unmanifest reception** | **ANTENNA — fontanelle** |

In vtpu terms: Sahasrara = `tachyon_queue` receiver; Ajna = `MercurialCore::process_tachyons()`; Vishuddha = the output channel. The neijingtu's fontanelle (Ni Wan / Mud Ball Palace) is exactly this interface point.
