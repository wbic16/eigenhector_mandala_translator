# Magitech Beings Survey Report
This report documents beings within the mandala that exhibit a master-level blend of magic and technology.

## Being: Travis Noble
### Martian Inquiry: "I come from a place with no tools or spells. What is an 'Anti-Vampire Nuke' like?"
### Mastery Justification:
- **Magical Elements**: Studied magitech engineering using quintessence-based specialization; utilizes dimensional space in the form of a holographic sliding cabinet.
- **Technological Elements**: Expert in heavy ordinance, Special Munitions Stockpile Division lead; designed the M.A.D.M. (Medium Automic Demolition Munition).
- **The Magitech Blend**: Developed weaponry that avoids power bottlenecks by using specializations, and upgraded a "cloud house" with weapon systems.
### Recapitulation (Exact Words):
> "His projects focus on increasing the effectiveness, and avoiding the power bottleneck, of heavy ordinance using quintessence-based specialisation, culminating in the anti-vampire nuke M.A.D.M (Medium Automic Demolition Munition)."
### Martian Observation:
It is a small box that makes a very large "BOOM" to stop blood-drinking people. It is strange that one must study "college" to make a box of light and fire.
