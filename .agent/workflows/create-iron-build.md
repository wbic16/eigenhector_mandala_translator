description: How to create a new companion adventurer build
---

Follow these steps to translate a mystic text into a standardized Iron Rank companion build.

1. **Research & Lineage Acquisition**
   - Read the provided Substack URL or text block.
   - Identify the primary author and the source URL.
   - Research at least two external lineage points (Wikipedia, etc.) mentioned in the text or relevant to its tradition.

2. **Identify the Chiral Pair**
   - Determine who the **Subject** (Hero) is.
   - Determine what the **Object** (Companion/Tool/Visitor) is.
   - Identify the **Theme** (the action that unifies them, e.g., "Inversion," "Oscillation," "Feeding").

3. **Generate Martian Bios (DIM Method)**
   - Use the `skills/DreamBridge/DIM.MD` methodology.
   - For both Hero and Companion, conduct a "Martian Interview."
   - **Rule**: Only use metaphors and descriptions found in the source text. Do not hallucinate standard RPG tropes.

4. **Construct the Build**
   - Use the template in `skills/COMPANION_BUILD_CREATION.MD`.
   - **Prefix**: Use the author's name (e.g., `EIGENHECTOR_` or `ARI_`).
   - **Soul Rank**: Set to `Iron`.
   - **Essence Triad**: Assign three essences based on the text (Magic, Technology, Light/Meaning).
   - **Attributes**: Scale from 1-10. Prioritize **Spirit** (usually 10) for mystic practitioners.

5. **Finalize & Verify**
   - Write the file to `skills/builds/[PREFIX]_[NAME].MD`.
   - Create a `walkthrough_[NAME].md` artifact to demonstrate how the text's specific motifs (e.g., "eels," "16mm film," "Gordian knots") were mapped to the build's abilities.
   - Ensure all **lineage links** in the frontmatter are valid and functional.
