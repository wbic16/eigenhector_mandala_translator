Chiral Mirror

Read this document and create a skill called CHIRAL_MIRROR.MD for agents to simulate a dialogue between two entities about how to bridge two mandalas.
Clearly document all research findings in the document so agents can refer to the concepts described here and reproduce the intent. including sample beings.
Read Skills/DreamBridge/DIM.MD to understand the martian interviewer and use that method for description.
Prefer two entities from different mandalas.
Use tools such as corpus indexing and analysis if needed to pick the two entities from the mystic corpus from two different mandalas.
If unavailable write quick tools to assist in picking the two entities.

This document describes a bohmian dialogue between two entities how they appear to each other through a chiral mirror.
Pick the two entities that are most likely to have an interesting conversation.

Use the following resources to understand the concepts an design the dialogue. Provide these options for agents to pick for the dialogue format.

A chiral mirror is a mirror that reflects the world in a way that is different from the original world by flipping an axis.
Think about how mirrors work in reality and imagine an idea mirror. Use the following axes for the chiral mirror and come up with interesting other reflections.

* Kiki, bouba mediated by matching
* truth, beauty mediated by love
* form, emptiness transforming into each other
* compassion, skillfull means

Each entity will have the following attributes, add more attributes that would be beautiful to see flipped over a chiral mirror from one mandala to another:

* Name
* Appearance
* Badges of Office - in tantric mandalas it would be things like jar of nectar, vajra, bell, lotus, prayer wheel, etc. Use martian interviewer to infer and describe these badges.
* hand mudras - these are symbolic hand gestures that are used in tantric mandalas to represent different concepts. Use martian interviewer to infer and describe these mudras.
* asana - the body posture

research how the following beings are described and extract out similar attributes, and things to describe

ganapati and ganas
sun wu kong and his monkeys


Decribe how entity A looks like in their home mandala
Describe how entity B looks like in their home mandala

The entities look at each other through the chiral mirror and see each other's reflections, have them describe each other through the chiral mirror and how they transmute their badges of office and appearance so that they can resonate with each other's mandala and flip over to the other side.

In the final image describe how the chiral mirror matches the reflections of one mandala to another using each point of view in each mandala.
Describe a good, true and beautiful thanga or tibetan mandala that represents this dialogue.

In the thangka these two beings are shown in yab-yum position, representing the union of opposites.
