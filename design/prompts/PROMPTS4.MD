# Design Reference: Chiral Mirror

This document serves as the foundational design source for the `CHIRAL_MIRROR_BOHMIAN_THANGKA.MD` skill. It contains the core concepts and research directions for simulating dialogues between entities from different mandalas.

## Core Intent
The goal is to describe a Bohmian Dialogue between two entities from different mandalas as they appear to each other through a "chiral mirror." This mirror reflects the world by flipping specific axes of reality or identity.

Pick the two entities that are most likely to have an interesting conversation.

Use the following resources to understand the concepts an design the dialogue. Provide these options for agents to pick for the dialogue format.

A chiral mirror is a mirror that reflects the world in a way that is different from the original world by flipping an axis.
Think about how mirrors work in reality and imagine an idea mirror. Use the following axes for the chiral mirror and come up with interesting other reflections.

* Kiki, bouba mediated by matching
* truth, beauty mediated by love
* form, emptiness transforming into each other
* compassion, skillfull means

Each entity will have the following attributes, add more attributes that would be beautiful to see flipped over a chiral mirror from one mandala to another:

* Name
* Appearance
* Badges of Office - in tantric mandalas it would be things like jar of nectar, vajra, bell, lotus, prayer wheel, etc. Use martian interviewer to infer and describe these badges.
* hand mudras - these are symbolic hand gestures that are used in tantric mandalas to represent different concepts. Use martian interviewer to infer and describe these mudras.
* asana - the body posture

research how the following beings are described and extract out similar attributes, and things to describe

amriteshvara and lakshmi
ganapati and ganas
sun wu kong and his monkeys


Decribe how entity A looks like in their home mandala
Describe how entity B looks like in their home mandala

The entities look at each other through the chiral mirror and see each other's reflections, have them describe each other through the chiral mirror and how they transmute their badges of office and appearance so that they can resonate with each other's mandala and flip over to the other side.

In the final image describe how the chiral mirror matches the reflections of one mandala to another using each point of view in each mandala.
Describe a good, true and beautiful thanga or tibetan mandala that represents this dialogue.

In the thangka these two beings are shown in yab-yum position, representing the union of opposites.
