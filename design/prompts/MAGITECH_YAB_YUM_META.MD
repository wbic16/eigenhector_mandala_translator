Create a skill called MAGITECH_YAB_YUM.MD that creates a magitech yab yum mandala for the user's mandala or realm instance.

The skill:

  Runs the magitech survey to find all beings in a realm instace, which many contain multiple mandalas.
  Save the survey as an MD for the user.
  Runs jataka tales on the survey to generate past life stories for each being.
  Save the jataka tales as an MD for the user.
  
  Finally it runs the chiral mirror to generate a dialogue similar to the one between bhairava and bhairavi in the vijana bhairava tantra.
