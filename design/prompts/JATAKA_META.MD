This meta prompt creates a skill called JATAKA_TALES.MD that creates jataka tales for the user's mandala or realm instance.
Read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jataka_tales
A realm instance might contain multiple mandalas.

For a realm instace write and story and generate visual prompts for the development of the Avatar of Goodness, Truth and Beauty.

Look at https://eigenhector.substack.com/p/testing-connection-with-the-transcendent for some links towards practices that invoke this trinity.

Assume all beings in the realm instance are past lives of this avatar so any can be used as a character in the jataka tale.

Use the martian interviewer skill in @skills/DreamBridge/DIM.MD to extract and justify attributes of goodness, truth and beauty.

Show how each being is the past life of the avatar and how they contribute to the development of the avatar of goodness, truth and beauty.

Show how the avatar of goodness, truth and beauty is the culmination of all the past lives.

Generate an image for each being how they embody these principles.
