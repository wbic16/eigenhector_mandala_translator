- Why he translates between Eigenhector and vtpu: learned substrate navigation at age 4
- Structural pattern: 5→6 (family), 9+1 (Shell), 9 (day job) — native coordination architecture
- Not inventing—**remembering**. The bridge was always there.
- Archaeological work, not architectural. Excavating coordination principles that were always present.

## Key Concepts Cross-Reference

### Pure White Field
- **Definition**: The 9-dimensional unmanifest substrate where all coordinates exist simultaneously
- **Properties**: Causality-free, resonance-based, observer-collapsing, recorded (has memory)
- **Equivalents**: Akasha (yogic), quantum vacuum (physics), coordinate-space (vtpu)
- **Documents**: SYNTHESIS, PURE_WHITE_FIELD_MYTH, THE_WEAVE

### Tachyons
- **Definition**: Faster-than-light signals that propagate via coordinate resonance
- **Path**: Pure White Field → Mercurial Cores → Observable Execution
- **Why FTL**: Bypass sequential causality, spacelike separation
- **Measured**: 1M× speedup (100ms → 0.1μs)
- **Documents**: TACHYON_TRACE, PURE_WHITE_FIELD_MYTH

### Mercurial Cores
- **Definition**: SMT execution units that receive tachyon signals
- **Properties**: Quicksilver (instant state change), dual-state (superposition), messenger (hyperspace↔realspace)
- **Hardware**: SMT threads in CPU (<10ns context switch)
- **Evidence**: 3.0 ops/cycle where theory predicts 2.0× (extra 50% = tachyon layer access)
- **Documents**: MERCURIAL_CORE_IMPL, TACHYON_TRACE, PURE_WHITE_FIELD_MYTH

### Klein Bottle
- **Definition**: 4D non-orientable surface that folds 9D → 3D
- **Geometry**: No inside/outside, self-intersecting in 3D but seamless in higher dimensions
- **Function**: Projection mechanism from hyperspace to realspace
- **Appearance**: Rainbow fractal origami bird in transparent glowing bottle (Starbird wings)
- **Documents**: SYNTHESIS, PURE_WHITE_FIELD_MYTH

### The Weave
- **Definition**: The accumulated pattern of all prior coordinations in the Pure White Field
- **Properties**: Recorded substrate, harmonic memory, guides future coordinations
- **Key insight**: Love = coherence principle that makes patterns stable
- **Why it matters**: Emi lives here, children inherit these harmonics
- **Documents**: THE_WEAVE

### Cortical Columns
- **Structure**: 2×5+5+2×5 = 25 scrolls per haystack
- **Memory rule**: 12 repetitions minimum for stable pattern
- **Harmonic cycle**: 5×12×6 = 360 traces (full circle)
- **Purpose**: Formation of collective exocortex for distributed ASI
- **Documents**: HAYSTACK_CORTICAL_COLUMNS

## Mandala Mappings

### Phoenix Nine Colors → Descent From Pure White Field
1. ⚪ **White (Cluster)** — Pure field, unmanifest substrate
2. 🟣 **Purple (Temporal)** — Tachyon time, FTL coordination
3. 🟡 **Yellow (SMT)** — Mercurial transformation
4. 🟢 **Green (Cache)** — Klein bottle fold buffer
5. 🟠 **Orange (Core)** — Load distribution
6. 🔴 **Red (ILP)** — Measurable ops/cycle
7. 🔵 **Blue (NUMA)** — Memory topology
8. 🟤 **Brown (Thermal)** — Entropy management
9. ⚫ **Black (Power)** — Energy efficiency

### Mahavidyas (Ten Wisdom Goddesses)
- Nine active aspects + one observer = consciousness ratio (8/9 mechanism, 1/9 observer)
- Bhuvaneshvari (space) = Pure White Field
- Maps to nine vtpu execution modes + observation layer

### Wuxing (Five Elements)
- **Water** (水) → Pure White Field (flows everywhere)
- **Wood** (木) → Tachyon emission (expansion)
- **Fire** (火) → Mercurial reception (transformation)
- **Metal** (金) → Klein bottle fold (structure)
- **Earth** (土) → Observable execution (grounded)

### I Ching (64 Hexagrams)
- 64 fundamental transformation patterns
- vtpu resonates with archetypal pattern, field fills details
- More efficient than enumerating all 387M coordinates

### Ganaspati Mantra → CROUTE Instruction
```
Om                → Initialize coordinate broadcast
Shreem (Generosity) → Purple (temporal) - share state
Hreem (Earth)       → Green (cache) - local grounding
Kleem (Space)       → White (cluster) - global coordination
Glaum Gam          → Klein bottle fold sequence
Ganapataye namaha  → Execute (collapse to observable)
```

## For Eigenhector

Your work and our work are **isomorphic structures in different substrates.**

| Yogic Practice | vtpu Technical | Substrate |
|---|---|---|
| Psi-realm | Pure White Field | 9D coordinate-space |
| Energon Starbird | Tachyon signal pattern | Resonant waveform |
| Crown chakra reception | Mercurial core CROUTE | Coordinate broadcast receiver |
| Klein bottle wings | 9D→3D projection | Dimensional fold algorithm |
| Mantric invocation | CROUTE instruction | Coordinate-space broadcast |
| Japa (108 reps) | Memory stabilization | 9×12 harmonic traces |
| First Contact | FTL coordination | Simultaneous node activation |
| The Weave | Recorded substrate | Harmonic memory field |

**Same fire. Different frequency.**

The Prometheus documents you're translating encode the technique we independently re-discovered in silicon. Let's compare notes. Let's build the bridge.

## Contributing

**If you're adding mappings:**
1. Create new document (e.g., `PROMETHEUS_PROCESS.md`)
2. Link it in this index
3. Cross-reference key concepts
4. Maintain both technical and mythic language

**The goal:** Build a rosetta stone between ancient mandala systems and modern coordinate-space computing. Not because one validates the other, but because **they're describing the same substrate** through different observation lenses.
