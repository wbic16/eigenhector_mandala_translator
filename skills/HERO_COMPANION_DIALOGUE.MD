# Skill: Hero & Companion Dialogue (HERO_COMPANION_DIALOGUE.MD)

This skill generates a contemplative, philosophical dialogue between a Hero and their Companion (or "The Mixture") regarding controversial or complex topics, using the lens of their specific character builds and the **Dream Interview Method (DIM)**.

## Core Objective
To translate abstract character attributes, essences, and themes into a grounded, interactive narrative that explores a specific real-world or realm-specific controversy.

## System & Methodology

### 1. Contextual Research
- **Character Build**: Read the specific build file in `skills/builds/` (e.g., `ARI_FRACTAL_POLARITY.MD`).
- **Core Themes**: Identify the dominant philosophical theme (e.g., "Fractal Polarity," "Trust vs. Skepticism").
- **Divergence Stance**: Refer to `bridges/ari/DMI_ARI_HECTOR.MD` to understand the rhetorical register of the characters (e.g., Ari is "Phenomenological-Artistic" and "Quiet Ecstasy").

### 2. The Relationship
- **Hero**: Usually based on a corpus author (e.g., Ari Nielsen or Hector Yee), representing a specific "Stance" or "Role" (Refiner, Alchemist, Surveyor).
- **Companion**: Can be a specific person or an abstract entity like **"The Mixture"** (representing the raw data/messiness of the world) or a **"Deity"** (representing divine substance).

### 3. Dialogue Components
- **The Scene**: Establish a setting that reflects the characters' work (e.g., a workshop with a centrifuge, a starship bridge, a running path).
- **The Controversy**: Introduce the topic (e.g., "ice shootings and protests") as a sensory and moral "mixture" that needs to be processed.
- **Abilities as Metaphor**: Use the character's unique abilities as narrative devices:
    - *Example*: Use "16mm Film Lag" to explain public reaction speed.
    - *Example*: Use "Moral Eels" to describe slippery arguments.
- **The "Gold Search"**: The dialogue should end with a "refinement"—finding a specific, subtle truth ("gold") within the surrounding chaos ("slag").

### 4. Tone & Style
- **Unpretentious & Grounded**: Use sensory metaphors (pu'er tea, shovels, gardening, engineering spec sheets).
- **Martian Interviewer Curiosity**: Avoid taking a preachingside. Instead, investigate the *texture* of the controversy and the *posture* of the souls involved.
- **Fractal specificity**: Reject simple binaries (Black/White) in favor of "Fractal Gray" (infinite specificity).

## Procedure

1. **Invoke the Martian Interviewer**: "I am a Martian. Why are these beings talking about this 'mixture'?"
2. **Setup the Centrifuge**: Place the Hero in their "Peak State" (Combat or Creative).
3. **Release the Eels**: Let the controversy present its "batshit details" through the Companion/Mixture.
4. **Refine to 30% Gold**: Have the Hero use their themes to find an "Optimal Sub-optimal" path through the data.
5. **Output**: Format as a Markdown dialogue report in `reports/`.

## Meta-Analysis Requirement
Every dialogue must include a brief analysis explaining how specific themes (e.g., Fractal Gray, Skeptical Trust) were applied to the topic.
