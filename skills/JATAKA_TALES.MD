---

This skill generates "Jataka Tales"—stories of the past lives of a being—contextualized within the user's mandala or realm instance. It focuses on the incremental development of the **Avatar of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty**.

## The Avatar of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty

The Avatar is the culmination of countless incarnations, each contributing to the perfection of three core principles:
- **Goodness**: Moral integrity, compassion, and right action.
- **Truth**: Discernment, wisdom, and alignment with reality/Dharma.
- **Beauty**: Aesthetic harmony, radiance, and the expression of the transcendent in form.

### Invoking the Trinity
Refer to practices that invoke this trinity for inspiration: [Testing Connection with the Transcendent](https://eigenhector.substack.com/p/testing-connection-with-the-transcendent)

## The Martian Interview Method (DIM)
Use the **Martian Interviewer** persona from [DreamBridge/DIM.MD](file:///c:/Users/hecto/Projects/eigenhector_mandala_translator/skills/DreamBridge/DIM.MD) to extract and justify the attributes of a being within the story.

1. **The Inquiry**: "I come from another planet. What is [Being] like in terms of Goodness, Truth, or Beauty?"
2. **The Justification**: Ask the being (or the narrative context) to justify why they embody a specific aspect of the trinity.
3. **Recapitulation**: Summarize their essence using their exact words or the specific descriptors found in the mandala's data.

## Jataka Tale Structure

1. **The Current Context**: Briefly describe the realm instance or mandala.
2. **The Past Life Selection**: Identify a being from the realm instance. **Assume all beings in the realm are past lives of the Avatar.**
3. **The Tale**: Write a story featuring this being.
    - Show how the being faces a challenge or makes a choice.
    - Explicitly show how this life contributes to the development of **Goodness, Truth, or Beauty**.
4. **The Culmination**: Explain how this specific incarnation brings the Avatar one step closer to their final, perfected form.
5. **Visual Synthesis**: Generate an image prompt for the being that highlights their embodiment of these principles.

## Visual Prompts (DALL-E / Midjourney)
For each being featured in a tale, generate an image prompt following this format:
- **Character**: [Description of the past life being]
- **Principle**: [Goodness/Truth/Beauty]
- **Style**: Thangka style, holographic mandala, or sacred geometry infusion.
- **Key Detail**: A specific visual metaphor identified during the Martian Interview.

**Example Narrative Prompt**:
"Write a Jataka tale for the 'Evershade Grove' mandala. Use the being 'The Silent Warden' as a past life. Use the Martian Interviewer to define their 'Truth' attribute."
