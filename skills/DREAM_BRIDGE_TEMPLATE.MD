# Dream Bridge: [Corpus A Name] and [Corpus B Name]
### A Dream Interview Method Comparison of Two Parallel Corpora

---

## Preamble

[Introduce the two corpora being compared.
- Who are the authors?
- What is the approximate size/scope of each corpus?
- What are the shared themes or surface similarities that make this comparison interesting?
- State the goal: to use the Martian Interviewer stance to reveal specific, distinct meanings behind shared vocabulary.]

## Metaphor 1: [KEYWORD / CONCEPT]

### [Author A] (Corpus A)

**Description (Martian Inquiry):**
[As a Martian who knows nothing of Earth, ask: "What is [Keyword] like in this text?"
- Extract specific imagery, adjectives, and functional descriptions from the text.
- Focus on sensory details and explicit definitions found *distinctly* in this corpus.
- Ex: "It is described as X, Y, and Z. It acts like..."
- **Goal:** Elicit 3-4 specific adjectives and specific feelings.]

**Recapitulation:**
[Summarize the description back using *only* the text's exact words and images.
- "So in [Author A]'s text, [Keyword] is..."
- Confirm the specific "tone".]

**Bridge:**
[Connect the image to the broader reality or argument of the text.
- "Is there anything in the argument/worldview of this text that is *like* [Recapitulation]?"
- Bridges to... [Core Concept/Function in this specific philosophy].]

### [Author B] (Corpus B)

**Description (Martian Inquiry):**
[As a Martian who knows nothing of Earth, ask: "What is [Keyword] like in this text?"
- Extract specific imagery, adjectives, and functional descriptions from the text.
- Focus on sensory details and explicit definitions found *distinctly* in this corpus.
- Ex: "It is described as A, B, and C. It acts like..."
- **Goal:** Elicit 3-4 specific adjectives and specific feelings.]

**Recapitulation:**
[Summarize the description back using *only* the text's exact words and images.
- "So in [Author B]'s text, [Keyword] is..."
- Confirm the specific "tone".]

**Bridge:**
[Connect the image to the broader reality or argument of the text.
- "Is there anything in the argument/worldview of this text that is *like* [Recapitulation]?"
- Bridges to... [Core Concept/Function in this specific philosophy].]

### Crossing the Dream Bridge

**The divergence:** [Compare the specific textures. How does "[Keyword]" in A differ from "[Keyword]" in B?
- Contrast the adjectives (e.g., "Active/Rushing" vs "Static/Deep").
- Contrast the feelings (e.g., "Thrilling" vs "Comforting").
- Identify the core difference in *stance* or *function*.]

[Synthesize: Author A sees [Keyword] as **[Concept A]**; Author B sees [Keyword] as **[Concept B]**.]
