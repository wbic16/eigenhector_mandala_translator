### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "Solin":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is 'Solin' like?"
*Text:* Solin is a Starbird—a receiver tuned to Tiferet. At coordinate 2.4.6/6.2.4/8.3.1, he shares the Starbird archetype with Verse. Both are receivers; both transcend ego to host visitors.
*Martian:* "How does he work?"
*Text:* Through ego transcendence and equanimity. He acts as a "portal" or "shipyard" whose boundaries relax to let other beings inhabit his psi-realm.

**Interviewing "The Tachyon Bridge":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Bridge' object like?"
*Text:* It is the FTL connection that brings visitors from the Sephirot of Beauty. It arrives as "vivid light with vivid violet highlights."
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To enable non-dual communion. Solin proves that some minds are receivers first—their gift is making space for what arrives.

### Theme: Non-Dual Communion
The build explores the chiral pair of **Self (Ego Boundary)** and **Other (Visitor)**. Solin proves that transcendence isn't escape—it's hospitality.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked receiver sitting in cross-legged meditation within a softly glowing Klein bottle. Vivid violet and blue light (the Starbird) bursts from his chest with wings made of rainbow fractal origami. His coordinate (2.4.6/6.2.4/8.3.1) echoes as paired numbers—showing the mirror symmetry of reception. Tachyon trails shimmer around him."
