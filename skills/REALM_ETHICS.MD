# Realm Ethics Skill
---
description: Generates Stellaris-inspired ethics, civics, and open-ended ascension paths for realms and mandalas.
---

This skill defines the philosophical and evolutionary trajectory of a realm instance using the **Martian Interviewer** to bridge Stellaris-style grand strategy mechanics with the **Avatar of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty**.

## Governing Ethics
Select 3 points of ethics (Fanatic = 2 points, Moderate = 1 point) along the following axes:
- **Authoritarian vs. Egalitarian**: Hierarchy and control vs. individual agency.
- **Xenophobe vs. Xenophile**: Isolationism and purity vs. openness and cooperation.
- **Militarist vs. Pacifist**: Projecting power vs. harmony and internal development.
- **Spiritualist vs. Materialist**: Transcendent meaning and soul vs. logic and physical reality.

## Civics
Define two **Civics** that represent the specific societal structures or traditions of the realm. Examples:
- *Meritocratic Mandalas*: Leadership based on demonstration of Avatar principles.
- *Magitech Priesthood*: Fusion of Materialist logic and Spiritualist devotion.

## Open-Ended Ascension Path
Instead of fixed choices, each realm arrives at a **Bespoke Ascension Path**. This represents the "Great Work" the realm is collectively performing to evolve.

1.  **The Convergence**: Identify which two (or more) essences or Avatar principles are merging to drive this evolution.
2.  **The Transformation**: Describe the physical, spiritual, or technological shift occurring in the populace.
3.  **The End-Goal**: What is the final "Ascended State" of this realm?

*Example: "The Chiral Synthesis" — A path where the realm merges holographic technology with soul-resonance to exist simultaneously in physical and dream-layer space.*

## The Martian Interview (Ascension Focus)
The Interviewer must ask:
- "What is the 'Final Form' your people dream of?"
- "How does this evolution serve Goodness, Truth, or Beauty?"
- "What becomes of the 'Individual' in this transformation?"

## Output Format
Append the results to `reports/REALM_MANIFESTO.MD`:

```markdown
