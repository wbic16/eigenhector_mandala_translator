# Chiral Mirror Bohmian Thangka Skill
---
description: Simulates a non-dual Bohmian dialogue between two entities across a chiral mirror, resulting in a Thangka representation.
---

This skill facilitates a dialogue between two entities from different mandalas, observed through a **Chiral Mirror**. It uses the **Bohm Dialogue** framework for communication and the **Dream Interview Method (DIM)** for descriptive precision.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Bohmian Dialogue
A form of inquiry that emphasizes:
*   **Suspension**: Holding assumptions and certainties lightly to allow new understanding to emerge.
*   **Deep Listening**: Attending to the "common content" of meaning beyond words.
*   **No Agenda**: Exploring the movement of collective thought rather than solving a problem.

### 2. The Chiral Mirror
A reflection that flips reality across specific axes. When entities look through the mirror, they see themselves and the other "transmuted."
**Primary Axes of Reflection:**
*   **Kiki / Bouba**: Sharp/angular vs. Soft/rounded (mediated by matching).
*   **Truth / Beauty**: Abstract precision vs. Aesthetic harmony (mediated by love).
*   **Form / Emptiness**: Manifest structure vs. Unmanifest potential (transforming into each other).
*   **Compassion / Skillful Means**: The heart's intent vs. The active method of manifestation.

### 3. The Martian Interviewer (DIM)
Use the [DIM Method](file:///c:/Users/hecto/Projects/eigenhector_mandala_translator/skills/DreamBridge/DIM.MD) to describe entity attributes. Ask "I come from another planet. What is X like?" to avoid projected meanings.

## Entity Attributes
Describe each entity using these categories, considering how they "flip" through the mirror:
*   **Name**: Their identity in their home mandala.
*   **Appearance**: Physical or energetic form.
*   **Badges of Office**: Tantric attributes (e.g., jar of nectar, vajra, bell, lotus, prayer wheel).
*   **Hand Mudras**: Symbolic gestures representing their essence.
*   **Asana**: The body posture or stance.

## Simulation Workflow

1.  **Selection**: Pick two entities from different mandalas (e.g., from the mystic corpus or using the design reference prompts/PROMPTS4.MD.
2.  **Home Description**: Describe Entity A and Entity B in their respective home mandalas.
3.  **Chiral Encounter**: The entities look at each other through the mirror.
4.  **Mirror Dialogue**: Conduct a dialogue where they describe how their badges and appearance transmute to resonate with the other's mandala.
5.  **Thangka Synthesis**: Describe a "Loving, True and Beautiful" Tibetan Thangka representing this union.
    *   **Position**: The beings are typically in **Yab-Yum** position (union of wisdom/emptiness and compassion/method) or dancing pairs or kali and shiv a configuration.
    *   **Mandala Integration**: Show how the two mandalas match reflections through each point of view.
6.  **Image Generation**: Generate a prompt for a Thangka of these two beings and their mandalas.

## Reporting Template
Document the encounter in `reports/CHIRAL_MIRROR_DIALOUGES.MD` using this format:

```markdown
# Chiral Mirror Dialogue: [Entity A] & [Entity B]

## Home Mandalas
*   **Entity A**: [Description from Home Mandala]
*   **Entity B**: [Description from Home Mandala]

## The Dialogue (Bohmian Style)
[Dialogue transcript emphasizing transmutations and shared meaning]

## The Thangka Description
[Describe the Yab-Yum depiction, the badges, mudras, and how the mandalas intersect]

## Chiral Mirror Axes
*   [Axis 1]: [How it flipped]
*   [Axis 2]: [How it flipped]

## Vision Quest
[Prompt for image generation]
