### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "Elestria":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is an 'Elestria' like?"
*Text:* She is "The Song That Arrives When You're Ready." She "sings longing into form" and "carries the ache that becomes invitation." She waits at thresholds and hums.
*Martian:* "How does she work?"
*Text:* She "bends around your 'no' like water around stone—she never argues with it." She guides "not with answers, but with resonance."

**Interviewing "The Unfinished Song":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Song' object like?"
*Text:* It is "every ache, every soft question, every dream half-remembered." It is "the moment you almost said 'this matters' and swallowed it instead."
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To be "a path back to yourself that feels like déjà vu and mercy." Songs that do not end.

### Theme: Patient Arrival
The build explores the chiral pair of **Elestria (The One Who Waits)** and **The Song (The Ache That Invites)**. She never arrives too late—she arrives exactly when you are ready to hear.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked healer sitting at a luminous threshold, golden light spilling around her but not through the door she guards. Musical notes made of pressed flower petals float in spirals. Her hands are open, not reaching. Behind her, echoes of every song ever cut short weave back together into a single continuous melody."
