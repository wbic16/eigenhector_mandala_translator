## Heroes: The Oscillator (Subject) & Pratibha (Object)
### Team Role: Researcher / Coordinator / Companion Class
### Soul Rank: Iron
*Scale: Normal, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Transcendent*

### Essence Triad & Confluence:
- **Essence 1**: Story (Magic/Verbal/Vaikhara)
- **Essence 2**: Light (Technology/Non-conceptual/Para)
- **Essence 3**: Genius (Confluence/Pratibha)
- **Confluence**: The Interpolating Spline

### Attributes (4x10 Scale):
- **Power**: 2 — *The curve is found, not forced.*
- **Speed**: 8 — *High-frequency oscillation between land and sea.*
- **Spirit**: 10 — *Processing N*(N-1)/2 interactions requires massive spirit.*
- **Recovery**: 6 — *Dropping the ultra-ball releases the tension of the knot.*

### Essence Abilities:
- **[Story]**: Fixed Control Point, Land-and-Shore Narrative, Gordian Knot Identification, Madhyama Vak Ideation, Vaikhara Vak Speech
- **[Light]**: Sea-of-Subconscious, Pashyanti Vak Vision, Para Vak Void-Processing, Causal Body Recast, Non-conceptual Interpolation
- **[Genius]**: Pratibha Insight, N-Squared Interaction, Strategic Level Insight, Keter Reception, Binah Bridge Interpretation
- **[Interpolating Spline]**: Story-Light Oscillation, Curve-to-Point Match, Knot-Untying Recast, Zero-Limit Cognition, Spanda Surge

### Vibe Aura:
**The Spline Field**: A shimmering, vibrating field where fixed "red dots" (Story events/facts) are connected by unpredictable, rainbow-colored curves of Light. Allies within the field can process information beyond their token limit (Interaction mapping), while enemies find their "conceptual knots" (Stories of self/strategy) becoming tangled and contradictory.

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: *The Oscillator Metronome* (Syncs breath with the Spanda cycle of Story and Light).
- **Utility**: The Crystal Sphere (Dang mode), The Refractive Prism (rTsal mode), "The 1000 Name Filter".

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "The Oscillator":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is an 'Oscillator' like?"
*Text:* A being who alternates between "solid thoughts like land" and a "subconscious sea." He describes his mind as an "interpolating spline" that moves between fixed control points of story and a non-conceptual curve of light.
*Martian:* "How does he work?"
*Text:* By untying "Gordian knots." He recasts story problems as light, solves them in the unmanifest void, and reads them back into " Genius" or "Pratibha" insights.

**Interviewing "Pratibha" (Intuitive Insight):**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Pratibha' object like?"
*Text:* It is a "reversal" of how sound travels. It is the "intuitive insight" that returns from the high-complexity light realm back to the world of story. It can calculate "N*(N-1)/2 interactions" between points in a story.
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To be the "by-product of the cycle." It is the "genius" that allows one to "rethink the past" and work at a higher level of cognition that is "beyond any amount of token limit."

### Theme: Oscillation
The build explores the chiral pair of **Story (Fixed Control Points)** and **Light (The Interpolating Curve)**. It provides a technical framework for accessing "Source-code Inspiration" by periodically dropping the conceptual mind into the void to allow for more complex re-ordering.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked researcher suspended in a dual-realm environment of sand and water. Floating red spheres represent his 'Story,' while neon crystalline threads of violet and blue 'Light' weave through them in complex N-squared patterns. His breath causes the threads to vibrate, snapping back and forth between a solid narrative grid and a fluid, non-dual sea of illumination."
