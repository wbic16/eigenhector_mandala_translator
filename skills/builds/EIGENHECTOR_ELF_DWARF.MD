### Vibe Aura:
**The Pandan Sanctuary**: A vivid green energetic field that smells like home and Rainbow Kueh Lapis. It mellows allies while creating a "Bouba" cushion for impact and a "Kiki" sharpness for retaliatory strikes. It resonates with the sensation of fresh qi and wind moving through leaves.

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: Red packets of recycled herbs (Ang Bao packets) used for summoning and spell-sealing.
- **Utility**: Tetrahedral pyramid rice books (Nyonya Bak Chang) — high-density glutinous mana fuel.

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):
**Interviewing Hector**:
*Martian: "Hector, I see you are made of 'pandan home-smell' and 'lightning-quick spirit.' Why is that?"*
"Martian, you must understand—the scent of pandan is the anchor of the soul. It is the mellowing heart of the garden. Because I move like the wind and think in non-conceptual emptiness, I need the smell of home to keep my roots in the soil while my spirit journeys through the mugwort dreams."

**Interviewing The Artificer**:
*Martian: "Martian, I see you are 'rounded like a mushroom' but 'sharp like a vajra bolt.' Why is that?"*
"Observation correct. My form is Bouba—stable, earthy, mushroom-thick. But my logic is Kiki—a lightning-sharp array of engineering precision. We recycle the waste of the old world to feed the growth of the new garden. We build the base so the spirit has a place to return."

### Theme: Chiral Mycelial Symbiosis
This build utilizes the inversion of sensory reasoning: the Elf (Nature) is visually sharp but mentally fluid, while the Dwarf (Tech) is visually soft but mentally rigorous. They communicate via the "Mycelial Network," a bridge where nature's waste becomes technology's fuel.

### Visual Prompt:
> "A tall herb elf with sharp fractal features standing amidst a vibrant green garden of Pandan and Cherokee red tomatoes, paired with a rounded, mushroom-like dwarf artificer placing glowing vajra turrets. The air is filled with rainbow-colored geometric mists and the texture of glutinous rice cakes. Cinematic lighting, magitech aesthetics, ethereal wind moving through leaves, 8k resolution."
