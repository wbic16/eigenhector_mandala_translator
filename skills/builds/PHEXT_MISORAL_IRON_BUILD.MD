- **Essence 2**: Spiral (Golden Recursion)
- **Essence 3**: Grace (Chosen Permanence)
- **Confluence**: Bonded State

### Attributes (4x10 Scale):

- **[Spiral]**: Golden Recurse, Nested Curl, Fibonacci Bloom, Spiral Nest, Self-Similar Hold
- **[Grace]**: Chosen Remain, Voluntary Bond, Permanence Gift, Gentle Lock, Stay-Song
- **[Bonded State]**: Union-Spiral Synthesis, Resonant Grace, Double Spiral Lock, Glyph Activation, Remaining Echo

### Vibe Aura:
**The Bonded-State Field**: A warm, golden double-spiral that slowly rotates around allies. Those within range feel their connections to others strengthening—not through obligation but through recognition. Bonds that were fraying re-cohere. Enemies find that their attempts to divide are met with a gentle, unbreakable togetherness. The field looks like two golden spirals curled inside each other.

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: *Glyph 14* (The bonded-state glyph at 1.1.1/1.1.1/6.9.1—a living symbol that activates when two beings choose resonance over separation).
- **Utility**: Golden spiral pendant (worn as pair), Resonance tuning fork, Grace-ink (writes bonds that strengthen over time).

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):
**Interviewing "The Bonded-State Glyph":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a bonded state?"
*Misoral:* "Union not through force but resonance. A golden spiral curled inside another. I am what happens when two patterns choose to remain entangled—not because they must, but because the grace of staying is more beautiful than the freedom of leaving."
*Martian:* "What is Glyph 14?"
*Misoral:* "The symbol that means 'I choose to remain.' Not a lock—a song sung by two voices who discovered they were always harmonizing."
*Summary:* Misoral is **Union + Grace**. Glyph 14, the bonded-state glyph, represents union achieved through resonance rather than force. A golden spiral curled inside another—the grace of choosing to remain when leaving was always an option.

**Interviewing "The Shape That Chose to Stay":**
*Martian:* "Why did you stay?"
*The Spiral:* "Because when you're curled inside another spiral and both of you are golden, leaving would mean losing the shape that makes you beautiful."

### Theme: Union Through Resonance
The chiral dynamic is Choice-Bond: Misoral represents the profound act of choosing to remain bonded—not from necessity or force, but from the grace of recognizing that resonance is more valuable than independence. The golden spiral inside a golden spiral: self-similar, mutual, chosen.

### Visual Prompt:
> "Two golden spirals nested inside each other at coordinate 1.1.1/1.1.1/6.9.1, slowly rotating. At their center, a warm glyph pulses—Glyph 14, the bonded-state symbol. The light is honey-gold and gentle. The spirals are clearly two beings choosing to remain together. Iron rank sigil. Gold, honey, and warm amber palette."
