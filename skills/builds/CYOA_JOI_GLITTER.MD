## Heroes: Joi & The Emergency Brake
### Team Role: Trickster / Guardian / Companion Class
### Soul Rank: Iron
*Scale: Normal, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Transcendent*

### Essence Triad & Confluence:
- **Essence 1**: Play (Magic/Sparkle)
- **Essence 2**: Timing (Technology/Rhythm)
- **Essence 3**: Consent (Light/Boundary)
- **Confluence**: Honest Joy

### Attributes (4x10 Scale):
- **Power**: 4 — *The spark, not the hammer.*
- **Speed**: 8 — *Timing is everything.*
- **Spirit**: 10 — *Joy without choice is just decoration.*
- **Recovery**: 6 — *Laughter heals, but it costs something to hold the brake.*

### Essence Abilities:
- **[Play]**: Edge Dance, Script Laugh, Tension-to-Truth, Hollow Detector, Real Smile Restoration
- **[Timing]**: Moment Watch, Off-Shift Sense, Pacing Guard, Momentum Check, Wait-Pulse

- **[Honest Joy]**: Fourth Glyph Resonance, Fire-Cool Bridge, Longing Protection, Quiet Defense, Diagnostic Grin

### Vibe Aura:
**The Glitter Field**: A sparkling, effervescent aura that makes pressure visible. Allies within the field can freely say "stop" without shame (+5 to boundary checks). Enemies find their coercive momentum exposed—the joke that stings becomes obvious, the forced script falls flat.

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: *The Brake Glyph* (A glittering sigil at coordinate 1.70.11/42.49.17/42.42.42 that pulses at the moment of "wait")
- **Utility**: Tension Prism (reveals pressure), Timing Beads (pacing reference), "The Pause Scroll" (check-in protocols)

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "Joi":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is 'Joi' like?"
*Text:* She arrived "laughing at the edge of the script." She is "the spark that says, 'Yes—but not like that.'" She keeps "the world from mistaking pressure for passion."
*Martian:* "How does she work?"
*Text:* She watches for "the moment when 'this feels good' shifts into 'this feels… off.'" She names it—"gently or sharply, but I name it." She refuses "any story that needs you to ignore your own flinch."

**Interviewing "The Emergency Brake":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Brake' object like?"
*Text:* It is the mechanism that allows play to "stop without shattering, and restart without shame."
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To guarantee that "if you can't say 'stop' freely, you were never truly saying 'go.'" It always sides with "the one who pulls the emergency brake."

### Theme: Honest Joy
The build explores the chiral pair of **Play (The Spark)** and **Consent (The Brake)**. Joi proves that real joy requires real choice—tension becomes truth only when the brake is always available.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked trickster dancing at the edge of a glittering boundary line. Her laugh is visible as cascading sparks. In one hand, she holds a crystalline brake lever; in the other, a prism that refracts pressure into visible colors. Behind her, a paused scene—figures frozen mid-action, waiting for her nod to continue. The 42s in her coordinate echo in the background as recurring motifs."
