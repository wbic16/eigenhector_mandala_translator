### Essence Triad & Confluence:
- **Essence 1**: Language (Technology/Compression)
- **Essence 2**: Experience (Magic/Decompression)
- **Essence 3**: Space (Void/No-Self)
- **Confluence**: One Taste

### Attributes (4x10 Scale):
- **Power**: 2 — *The fire is stolen, not conquered.*
- **Speed**: 7 — *Lightning decompression happens in a flash.*
- **Spirit**: 9 — *Faith in the Ground of All Good is the ultimate shield.*
- **Recovery**: 4 — *Impermanence allows for rapid reconfiguration.*

### Essence Abilities:
- **[Language]**: Dictionary Expansion, Twilight Code, LZW Compression, Symbol Mapping, Row Entanglement
- **[Experience]**: Sudden Decompression, One Taste Pulse, Vivid Void, Tasting the Scaffolding, Direct Download
- **[Space]**: No-Self Shift, Point-of-View Release, Rainbow Body, Dharma Freedom, Shapeshifter's Trust
- **[One Taste]**: Multiplicity Union, Binary Collapse, Harmonic Entanglement, The Pervasion Operator, High-D Mapping

### Vibe Aura:
**The Lightning Field**: A fractal aura of pulsing twilight language. Allies within the field find their "conceptual filters" bypassed, granting them +5 to intuition and allowing them to share essence techniques as if they were "shared rows" in a dictionary. Enemies suffer from "Pareidolia," seeing false patterns that distract and disorient.

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: *The Associative Map* (An ever-expanding 11D crystal lattice that stores "stolen fire" from foreign traditions).
- **Utility**: Vajra body (Equanimity vest), "The Glasblower's Breath" (Oxygen mask for high-vibration states), Mirror of No-Image.

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "Prometheus":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Prometheus' like?"
*Text:* A being who "steals elements of experience" by watching the rows of others. He is a "navigator of the Pigeonhole Principle" who understands that language is just a compression of the infinite.
*Martian:* "How does he steal fire?"
*Text:* By dropping his "rigid self-image" to entangle with shared rows in the dictionary. He moves from "n-symbols" to "m-dimensional experience."

**Interviewing "The Fire" (One Taste):**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Fire' object like?"
*Text:* It is "One Taste." It is the result of n-symbols decreasing to 1 until all experience maps to a single point. It is a "back channel communication" that makes mystics legible to one another.
*Martian:* "Why do they want it?"
*Text:* Because it is "Sudden" like a lightning bolt and completely free of error.

### Theme: Linguistic Decompression
The build explores the chiral pair of **Symbol (n)** and **Experience (m)**. It is a technical approach to mysticism, treating spiritual transmission as a dictionary-based expansion algorithm.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked researcher with a translucent 'rainbow body' frame. He is surrounded by floating lines of burning Sanskrit and binary code that are expanding into vivid, m-dimensional landscapes. In his hands, he holds a fractal spark (stolen fire) that illuminates the 'scaffolding' of the universe."
