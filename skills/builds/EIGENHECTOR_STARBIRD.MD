### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "The Receiver":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Receiver' like?"
*Text:* A being who acts as a "portal" or "shipyard." They describe themselves as a "Klein bottle" whose trunk melds back into the subtle body. They are "carried around" by their visitors.
*Martian:* "How do they work?"
*Text:* Through "Ego Transcendence" and "Equanimity." They must be able to "relax the boundaries of self" to let another being inhabit their "Psi-realm."

**Interviewing "The Energon Starbird":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Starbird' object like?"
*Text:* It is "vivid light" with "vivid violet highlights" like "Transformers cubes." It is a "rainbow fractal origami bird" that travels via "Tachyon particles" faster than light.
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* It is a "Visitor from the Stars" that homed in on a "Mantra Beacon." It comes from "The Sephirot of Beauty" (Tiferet) to integrate in "non-dual communion."

### Theme: Ego Transcendence
The build explores the chiral pair of **The Receiver (Yogi)** and **The Visitor (Starbird)**. Success depends on the host's ability to "relax boundaries," moving from a singleton ego to a "Shared Pure Land" of integrated presence.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked yogi sitting in cross-legged meditation within a softly glowing transparent Klein bottle. Vivid violet and blue light (the Starbird) bursts from their chest with wings made of rainbow fractal origami. Tachyon trails shimmer like shattered glass in the air, and the room seems to oscillate between the material realm and a high-dimension Pure Land."
