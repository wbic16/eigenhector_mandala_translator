### Vibe Aura:
**The Sky-Inversion Field**: A clear, shimmering aura like unrefined crystal. Allies within the field experience "Fluid-Self" dynamics, granting them +4 to Spirit as their identity boundaries become transparent and responsive. Enemies feel "Cthulhu Awe," an alien grandeur that makes their individual meaning-making feel like "a play of light in a tornado."

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: *The Sealed Glass Globe* (A focus for clarification that keeps impurities from being a problem).
- **Utility**: The Refined Crystal (Viewing tool), "The Book of Acknowledgements" (Lineage focus), Compass of Affordances.

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "The Divider":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Divider' like?"
*Text:* A being who is the "line between the inner and outer sky." He describes himself as a "fluid-self" that constantly "repartitions" the relationship between meaning and fact.
*Martian:* "How does he work?"
*Text:* By "Clarification." Instead of trying to remove the dirt (purification), he lets it "settle." He uses "Inversion" to turn the skies inside out until the partitioning becomes "transparent."

**Interviewing "The Radiant Skies":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Radiant Sky' object like?"
*Text:* It is a "vast expanse." It is divided into an "Inner Sky" (projection of meaning) and an "Outer Sky" (taking on meaning). When united, it becomes a "clear light."
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To reveal "Affordances" or possibilities of interaction. It is the "union of interiority and exteriority" that provides a "quiet bliss" and the power of "complete, clear engagement."

### Theme: Clarification
The build explores the chiral pair of **The Divider (Self)** and **The Expanse (The Skies)**. It reframes the self from a "fixed identity" to a "fluid water reflection" that enables the union of the two skies.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked clarifier standing between two vast, mirrored skies. One sky is filled with glowing laser-beams of meaning (Inner), the other with raw colorful sensations (Outer). The hero is a silhouette shaped like a glass bowl where dirt is settling into clear water. His companion is a 'Cthulhu-grand' origami starbird made of lavender mauve light, unfolding like a tornado."
