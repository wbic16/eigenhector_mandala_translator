### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "The Sadhu":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Sadhu' like?"
*Text:* An expert in navigating "cremation grounds." They are beings who can "project into a body" to visit others. They wear skull necklaces and carry tridents as badges of office. 
*Martian:* "What are they doing?"
*Text:* They are "Guiding Ghosts" and practicing "Skull Shining." They are observers who seek the "Pure Bliss of fire and air."

**Interviewing "The Burning Skeleton":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Burning Skeleton' object like?"
*Text:* It is a "Dependent Co-arising Corpse" that appears in the Black Lands. It is not a monster, but a "practice-giver." It is made of "burning bones of sacred light."
*Martian:* "How does it function?"
*Text:* It works through the "Purification of Five Elements." It turns flesh into fire and blood into steam until only "Open Awareness" remains.

### Theme: Elemental Alchemy
The build explores the chiral pair of **The Observer (Sadhu)** and **The Process (The Burning Corpse)**. It transforms the "Black Land" (death/destruction) into a site of "Sacred Light" and "Radiant Bones."

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked purifier sitting in perfect shavasana amidst a spectral cremation ground. Their form is a dual-layered manifestation: a serene Sadhu with a trident and one made of glowing, burning bones. Swirls of steam and sacred fire dance around them, dissolving into the deep violet space of the background."
