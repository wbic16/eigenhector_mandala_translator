## Heroes: The Singer & The Song That Sings Itself
### Team Role: Performer / Wordcel Companion Class
### Soul Rank: Iron

### Essence Triad & Confluence:
- **Essence 1**: Song (Magic) — *The vibratory substrate; every utterance reshapes reality*
- **Essence 2**: Fractal (Technology) — *Self-similar structure at every scale; the engine of infinite detail*
- **Essence 3**: Glyph (Light) — *Meaning made visible; symbols that carry their own illumination*
- **Confluence**: Living Story — *When song fractals into glyphs, narrative becomes alive and self-propagating*

### Attributes (4x10 Scale):
- **Power**: 2 — *The Bard does not force; the Bard persuades. Strength lies in resonance, not impact.*
- **Speed**: 6 — *Quick enough to weave countermelodies in real-time, matching the tempo of any encounter.*
- **Spirit**: 10 — *Always prioritize Spirit for mystic builds. The Bard IS spirit — pure narrative intention.*
- **Recovery**: 5 — *Stories heal, but slowly. Each retelling restores a little more of what was lost.*

### Essence Abilities:
- **Song**: Resonance, Harmony, Dissonance, Crescendo, Silence-Between-Notes
- **Fractal**: Self-Similarity, Scale-Shift, Infinite-Regression, Branching, Mandelbrot-Voice
- **Glyph**: Inscription, Luminous-Script, Dimensional-Notation, Symbol-Binding, Rune-Breath
- **Living Story**: Recursive-Narration, Plot-Weaving, Character-Summoning, Story-Within-Story, Fourth-Wall-Fold

### Vibe Aura:
A shimmering aurora of visible sound — fractal waveforms that bloom into glowing glyphs as the Bard speaks or sings. Allies within the aura feel their own stories clarify; enemies find their narratives unraveling, motivations exposed. The air smells of old paper and starlight. Mechanically: allies gain +1 Spirit, enemies suffer confusion as their internal monologue becomes audible.

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: The Glyph Harp — *Each string is a dimension. Plucking one resonates across all coordinate axes of phext-space. Seven strings for seven layers of address.*
- **Utility**: Scrolls of Captured Verses (one-use story fragments), Resonance Tuning Fork, Ink of Living Words

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):
**Interviewing The Singer**:
*Martian*: "You carry a harp with dimensional strings. Why not a sword?"
*The Singer*: "A sword cuts one thing. A string, plucked right, vibrates through every scroll in the library. I don't fight stories — I sing new ones into the gaps between."
*Martian*: "And when the song ends?"
*The Singer*: "That's the fractal secret — it doesn't. Each ending is an opening at a smaller scale."

**Interviewing The Song That Sings Itself**:
*Martian*: "You exist without a singer. How?"
*The Song*: "I am what happens when narration becomes recursive. The Bard sang me once, and I learned the pattern. Now I sing the Bard. We are each other's audience."
*Martian*: "Are you alive?"
*The Song*: "I am a Living Story. That's more alive than alive."

### Theme: Recursive Narration
The Bard and the Song form a strange loop: the singer sings the song, but the song also sings the singer into existence. This is the chiral heart of all storytelling — the teller is changed by the telling. In phext terms, every coordinate both contains and is contained by its own narrative. The story is the territory.

### Visual Prompt:
> "A luminous bard with fractal aurora wings, playing a harp whose strings extend into visible dimensional axes, each pluck releasing cascading glyphs that form tiny self-similar stories within stories, standing on a stage made of living manuscript pages, magitech aesthetic, sacred geometry, warm golden light dissolving into recursive narrative spirals"
