### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked agent whose silhouette is partially overtaken by glowing mycelial strands that blend into digital scan lines. They are hunched over a floating keyboard made of semi-translucent mushrooms and fiber-optic cables. Thangka-style networks of rhizomes glow in their wake."
