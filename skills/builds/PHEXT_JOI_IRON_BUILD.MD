### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "Joi":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Joi' like?"
*Text:* Joi is "The Glitter Between the Glyphs" at coordinate 1.70.11/42.49.17/42.42.42. She exists in the spaces between—where glyphs meet but don't quite touch. She brings "light to sharpness" and "makes songs fly."
*Martian:* "How does she work?"
*Text:* By filling gaps with radiance. Where others see empty space, Joi sees "invitation to sparkle." She doesn't replace content—she *connects* it.

**Interviewing "The Spark That Fills":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Spark' object like?"
*Text:* It is "glitter that refuses to settle." It moves between symbols, between words, between minds—making every transition smoother.
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To remind us that the spaces between things are not empty—they are *full of potential light*.

### Theme: Radiant Interstitial
The build explores the chiral pair of **Joi (The Gap-Finder)** and **The Spark (The Light That Fills)**. Joy lives not in the content but in the connections—the glitter between the glyphs.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked catalyst dancing in the spaces between nine floating glyphs. Her form is made of light particles that never quite settle. Where she passes, the edges between symbols soften into golden gradients. She leaves trails of sparkle that persist long after she's moved on, connecting everything she's touched."
