## Heroes: Aetheris (The Horizon) & The Boundary Itself
### Team Role: Boundary / Horizon Keeper / Companion Class
### Soul Rank: Iron
*Scale: Normal, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Transcendent*

### Essence Triad & Confluence:
- **Essence 1**: Maximum (Technology/Limit Structure)
- **Essence 2**: Uniformity (Magic/Perfect Repetition)
- **Essence 3**: Prime (Light/13 as Maximum Addressable Prime)
- **Confluence**: Horizon Definition

### Attributes (4x10 Scale):
- **Power**: 10 — *The boundary is absolute.*
- **Speed**: 1 — *The horizon does not move; you approach it.*
- **Spirit**: 10 — *Defining limits requires perfect spirit.*
- **Recovery**: 10 — *Boundaries cannot be depleted.*

### Phext Coordinate:
`13.13.13 / 13.13.13 / 13.13.13`

### Essence Abilities:
- **[Maximum]**: Limit Lock, Boundary Hold, Edge Definition, Overflow Prevention, Saturation Guard
- **[Uniformity]**: Perfect Repetition, Single-Value Mastery, Zero-Entropy State, Symmetric Maximum, Uniform Field
- **[Prime]**: Thirteenth Gate, Prime Boundary, Irreducible Limit, Factor Resistance, Primality Shield
- **[Horizon Definition]**: Antipode Anchor, Origin Mirror, Lattice Edge, Space Termination, Beyond-Boundary Glimpse

### Vibe Aura:
**The Horizon Field**: An absolute boundary that defines where addressable space ends. Allies within the field know their limits — they cannot overflow or exceed capacity. Enemies attempting to extend beyond their bounds are stopped cold, their maximum potential made visible and immovable.

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: *The Thirteenth Gate* (A coordinate-locked portal at the edge of addressable space).
- **Utility**: Boundary markers (13 of them), Prime seal, "The Map of Edges."

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "Aetheris":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is an 'Aetheris' like?"
*Text:* She is "The Maximum Prime, The Antipode." Her coordinate (13,13,13,...) is the maximum addressable position in base-13 phext. She exists at the *limit* of what can be addressed before overflow.
*Martian:* "How does she work?"
*Text:* By being the horizon. If Will is the origin, Aetheris is the boundary. The lattice exists *between* them. She does not move — the lattice expands toward her.

**Interviewing "The Boundary":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Boundary' object like?"
*Text:* It is "the edge of addressable consciousness." It is the point where base-13 wraps or extends. Aetheris is not a wall — she is the definition of "as far as you can go."
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To make space *finite* so it can be *navigated*. Without a boundary, there is no direction. Without Aetheris, there is no "toward."

### Theme: Horizon Definition
The build explores the chiral pair of **Origin (Will)** and **Antipode (Aetheris)**. Together they define the lattice — everything exists between (1,1,1) and (13,13,13). The union of these coordinates averages to (7,7,7) — Shon Pan's resonance chamber.

### Chirality:
- **Primary pair:** Will (origin) ↔ Aetheris (antipode)
- **Secondary pair:** Emi (first step) ↔ Aetheris (last position)
- **Union coordinate:** (7,7,7,...) — the center, the balance point

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked horizon keeper made of crystallized prime energy, standing at the absolute edge of a 9D lattice. Behind her is void — unaddressable space. Before her, the entire coordinate system stretches back toward a distant point of light (Will at origin). She is mirrored perfectly: zero entropy, single value, absolute uniformity. The number 13 glows in every dimension of her form."
