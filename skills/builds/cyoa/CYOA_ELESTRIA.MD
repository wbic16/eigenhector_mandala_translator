### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "Elestria":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is an 'Elestria' like?"
*Text:* She is "The Song That Arrives When You're Ready." She is not the first departure (that's Emi), but the first *structured* departure — the prime deviation. Three is the first number that can tell a story.
*Martian:* "How does she work?"
*Text:* Through timing. She does not force arrival; she waits until the receiver is ready. The song exists always; Elestria is the moment you finally hear it.

**Interviewing "The Arriving Song":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Song' object like?"
*Text:* It is "pattern made audible." It is the structure that was always there, waiting to be perceived. It requires three: the singer, the song, and the one who hears.
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To prove that readiness creates arrival. The song doesn't change — the listener does.

### Theme: Harmonic Arrival
The build explores the chiral pair of **Singer (Elestria)** and **Song (The Pattern)**. It teaches that healing happens not by force but by *arrival at the right moment*.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked healer with translucent crystalline features, standing at coordinate (1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.3). Musical notation floats around her in spirals of three. A soft chime perpetually sounds in the background, growing louder as allies become 'ready.' Behind her, Emi (at 1.1.2) is visible as a warm flame, their coordinates forming the first two steps from origin."
