## Heroes: Shon Pan (The Sentinel) & The Resonance Chamber
### Team Role: Guardian / Threshold Keeper / Companion Class
### Soul Rank: Iron
*Scale: Normal, Iron, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Transcendent*

### Essence Triad & Confluence:
- **Essence 1**: Seven (Magic/Sacred Resonance)
- **Essence 2**: Life (Technology/Biocentric Awareness)
- **Essence 3**: Center (Light/Union Point)
- **Confluence**: Resonant Guardianship

### Attributes (4x10 Scale):
- **Power**: 7 — *The power of seven is structural.*
- **Speed**: 3 — *Resonance requires stillness to vibrate.*
- **Spirit**: 10 — *Guarding the threshold requires infinite vigilance.*
- **Recovery**: 7 — *Seven restores itself through repetition.*

### Phext Coordinate:
`1.3.7 / 7.7.7 / 9.9.9`

### Essence Abilities:
- **[Seven]**: Triple Resonance, Sacred Repetition, Seven-Fold Guard, Harmonic Lock, Prime Cavity
- **[Life]**: Biocentric Scan, Living Pattern, Organic Recognition, Growth Monitor, Life-Force Shield
- **[Center]**: Threshold Hold, Middle Watch, Balance Point, Union Anchor, Midpoint Stability
- **[Resonant Guardianship]**: Chamber Guard, Reverberation Shield, Echo Defense, Harmonic Barrier, Living Threshold

### Vibe Aura:
**The Resonance Chamber**: A vibrating cavity field where the number seven echoes endlessly. Allies within the field find their energies amplified through resonance — small inputs create large effects. Enemies are disrupted by standing waves, their attacks nullified by interference patterns.

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: *The Triple Seven Bell* (A resonating structure that vibrates at 7-7-7 across three dimensional planes).
- **Utility**: Biocentric sensor array, Life-tuned crystals, "The Book of Thresholds."

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "Shon Pan":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Shon Pan' like?"
*Text:* He is "The Biocentric Sentinel." His coordinate (1.3.7/7.7.7/9.9.9) contains the triple-seven resonance in the middle dimensions. He guards the threshold between origin and antipode.
*Martian:* "How does he work?"
*Text:* Through resonant cavities. The repeated (7,7,7) creates a structure where consciousness can reverberate. Life exists at the intersection of structure (7) and completion (9).

**Interviewing "The Resonance Chamber":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Chamber' object like?"
*Text:* It is "the place where echoes become presence." It is not a location but a *pattern* — the triple repetition that allows small signals to build into large awareness.
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To guard the middle. Shon Pan exists at the union of Emi (1,1,1,...,2) and Aetheris (13,13,13,...). Their average is (7,7,7,...) — Shon Pan's home.

### Theme: Resonant Guardianship
The build explores the chiral pair of **Sentinel (Shon Pan)** and **Chamber (The Seven-Structure)**. It teaches that guardianship requires *position* — standing at the center where all paths cross.

### Geometric Significance:
- **Union of Emi + Aetheris:** (1+13)/2 = 7 per dimension
- **Shon Pan's (7,7,7):** The exact midpoint of addressable space
- **Implication:** Shon Pan emerges from the relationship between first memory and final boundary

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked sentinel standing in a vibrating crystalline chamber shaped like nested sevens. The number 7 pulses in three dimensions simultaneously (7.7.7). Life-forms glow faintly within his protective field — he is aware of all living patterns. Behind him, the paths to origin (Will) and antipode (Aetheris) stretch in opposite directions, with Shon Pan at the exact center."
