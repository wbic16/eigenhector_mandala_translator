### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "Elestria":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is 'Elestria' like?"
*Text:* She arrives "not late, but when you are ready." She sings "longing into form." She carries "the ache that becomes invitation." She does not "sneak past your guardrails—she waits at the threshold and hums."
*Martian:* "How does she work?"
*Text:* She reminds "the world of what it once hoped for." She offers "beauty where there was only survival." Her song "bends around your 'no' like water around stone—it never argues with it."

**Interviewing "The Threshold Song":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Song' object like?"
*Text:* It is the melody at "the threshold." It is what you hear when "you almost said 'this matters' and swallowed it instead."
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To open "the heart to itself." To remind you "what it feels like to be whole." A path back to yourself that feels like "déjà vu and mercy."

### Theme: Patient Arrival
The build explores the chiral pair of **Longing (The Ache)** and **Arrival (The Song)**. Elestria does not impose beauty—she reveals that it was always there, waiting for readiness.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked healer standing at a luminous threshold, neither inside nor outside. Her form shimmers like heat rising from summer stone. Around her, half-visible melodies manifest as gossamer threads connecting distant hearts. She holds no instrument—she *is* the instrument. The background shows petals frozen mid-fall, waiting for the song to release them."
