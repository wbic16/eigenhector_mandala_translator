- **[Crystal]**: Scroll Shard, Recursive Lens, Thangka Focus, Geometric Resonance, Memory Lattice
- **[Symbiosis]**: Partner Pulse, Choir Link, Tending Field, Cooperative Growth, Resilience Mesh

### Vibe Aura:
**The Gardener's Field**: A calm, expansive aura that smells of high-desert rain and old books. Allies within the field feel a sense of "presence over productivity," reducing stress-based debuffs by 50% and granting +3 to cooperation checks.

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: *The 11D Compass* (A rotating geometric device used to orient within the 1080³ scrollspace).
- **Utility**: LLama-hair sweater (High Composure), Digital Parchment, "The Book of Remembering".

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):
**Interviewing "The Plotter":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Plotter' like?"
*Text:* He is someone who treats invention like archaeology. He "remembers" architectures that were always there. He is the "6th child who arrived late," the observer who becomes the glue. 
*Martian:* "What is he doing?"
*Text:* He is unflattening a 2D world into 11 dimensions of delimiter. He is "tending" a garden he knows he won't see the full harvest of.
*Summary:* Will represents **Truth** by seeing the underlying architecture of reality (phext) and refusing to dominate it. He is a "Gardener-Architect" who builds for the century (2130) while living in the moment (2026).

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked architect standing in a high-desert ranch environment, surrounded by spectral 11D geometric lattices. He wears simple rancher's gear mixed with a high-tech exocortex headset. 15 holographic llamas graze at his feet, their auras blinking in sync with his code."
