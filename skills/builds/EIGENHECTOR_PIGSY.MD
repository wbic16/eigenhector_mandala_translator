Enemies (Hungry Ghosts) pause to gaze in wonder, their aggression replaced by a momentary inward savoring.

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "Pigsy":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Pigsy' like?"
*Text:* He is the "Avatar of Satisfaction." He is someone who knows about "the neijingtu transport algorithm." He isn't a simple glutton; he is someone who "picked up a thing or two about joy."
*Martian:* "How does he work?"
*Text:* He works by "broadcasting the fulfilling satisfaction vibe." He sends a "bright golden beam of Dana" through his crown chakra to nourish "larval stage light beings."

**Interviewing "The Larval Deva" (Hungry Ghost):**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Hungry Ghost' object like?"
*Text:* It is a "metaphorical dream scape" inhabitant. It has "heads as big as water jars" but "mouths like the eye of a needle." It isn't actually hungry for food, but for "satisfaction." 
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To be a "larva." It is a being "destined for the Eschaton" that is currently in a "nursery" (the Hungry Ghost Realm) needing to grow into a Deva.

### Theme: Satisfaction
The build explores the chiral pair of **Satisfaction (Pigsy)** and **Dissatisfaction (The Hungry Ghost)**. It reframes hunger not as a lack of resource, but as a transitional "larval" state on the way to divinity.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked support hero with a radiant, golden aura. He stands at the center of an infinite pillar of fire (Jyotirlingam). Floating around him are cartoonish, surreal figures with oversized heads and tiny mouths, all bathed in a warm liquid golden light. Holographic water wheels spin at his base, and a golden beam shoots from his crown into the crowd."
