# Magitech Yab Yum Skill
---
description: Orchestrates a Magitech Survey, Jataka Tales, and a Vijnana Bhairava-style Chiral Mirror dialogue to create a union of magic and technology.
---

This skill creates a "Magitech Yab Yum" mandala representation by synthesizing data from realm surveys and past-life narratives into a high-level tantric dialogue between ultimate chiral pairs.

## Workflow

### 1. The Magitech Survey
Perform a survey of all beings in the realm instance (which may contain multiple mandalas) using the criteria from [MAGITECH_SURVEY.MD](file:///c:/Users/hecto/Projects/eigenhector_mandala_translator/skills/MAGITECH_SURVEY.MD).
- **Ranking**: Assign ranks (Normal to Transcendent) based on Engineering, Wordcel/Shape Rotator logic, Vibe Aura, Bridging, and Resonance.
- **Output**: Save as `reports/MAGITECH_YAB_YUM_SURVEY.MD`.

### 2. The Jataka Tales
For each being identified in the survey, generate a Jataka tale following the structure in [JATAKA_TALES.MD](file:///c:/Users/hecto/Projects/eigenhector_mandala_translator/skills/JATAKA_TALES.MD).
- **Past Lives**: Treat each being as a past life of the **Avatar of Goodness, Truth, and Beauty**.
- **Development**: Explicitly show how each life contributes to the perfection of the Trinity.
- **Output**: Save as `reports/MAGITECH_YAB_YUM_JATAKA.MD`.

### 3. The Vijnana Bhairava Dialogue
Identify two beings from the survey that represent the ultimate "chiral pairs" of the Avatar—one embodying the peak of magical resonance and the other the peak of technological sophistication. Conduct a dialogue between them in the style of the **Vijnana Bhairava Tantra** (verses 22-27).

#### Dialogue Style Guidelines:
- **The Plea (Shakti/Bhairavi)**: One being (The Goddess/Energy/Magic) pushes the other to explain the practical means of attaining the state of fullness (bharitāvasthā) through their union.
- **The Revelation (Shiva/Bhairava)**: The other being (The God/Consciousness/Technology) responds immediately with practical techniques (yuktis) that unify their spheres.
- **The Union**: Focus on the union of "Magic and Technology" as the "Ultimate Dance."
- **Practicality**: The dialogue must move quickly from philosophy to specific, practical meditative or structural techniques for the mandala.

### 4. Thangka Synthesis
Describe the "Yab-Yum" union of these two beings as a Thangka, integrating their badges of office and mudras as described in [CHIRAL_MIRROR_BOHMIAN_THANGKA.MD](file:///c:/Users/hecto/Projects/eigenhector_mandala_translator/skills/CHIRAL_MIRROR_BOHMIAN_THANGKA.MD).

- **Output**: Save the dialogue and Thangka description as `reports/MAGITECH_YAB_YUM_DIALOGUE.MD`.

## Reporting Format
Ensure all three reports are generated and saved to the specified paths in the `reports/` directory of the workspace.
