# Dream Bridge
### A Method for Comparing Metaphors Across Parallel Corpora

This guide adapts the **Dream Interview Method (DIM)**—a technique originally designed to interpret dreams by stripping away assumptions—for the purpose of analyzing and comparing metaphors between two parallel corpora of texts (Corpus A and Corpus B). By treating text segments as "dream images" and the analyst as a "Martian" interviewer, this method reveals the unique, culturally specific meanings behind metaphors that might otherwise appear identical on the surface.

### Phase 1: The Setup
**The Martian Perspective**
The core of the Dream Bridge method is the adoption of a specific persona: the **Martian Interviewer**. You must pretend you have just arrived from another planet and know absolutely nothing about life on Earth, its customs, or its symbols.

*   **Why?** This prevents you from projecting your own definitions or "prefabricated interpretations" onto the text.
*   **The Rule:** Do not use "dream dictionaries" or standard symbolic meanings (e.g., "water always means emotion"). Throw them out. Instead, you will elicit the meaning entirely from the text's own descriptions.

### Phase 2: The Interview Process
Perform the following steps separately for the metaphor in **Corpus A** and then for the metaphor in **Corpus B**.

#### Step 1: Description (The "Alien" Inquiry)
Select the target metaphor (e.g., "The Forest") in the text. As the Martian Interviewer, ask the text (or yourself as the reader-proxy) to describe the image as if you have never seen it before.

*   **Ask:** "I come from another planet. What is a 'Forest' like?"
*   **Ask:** "What is the Forest doing in this specific passage? What is the feeling associated with it?"
*   **Ask:** "Pretend I don't know what this object is used for. How does it work?"
*   **Goal:** Elicit 3-4 specific adjectives and feelings. Does Text A describe the forest as "dark, ancient, and suffocating" while Text B describes it as "green, resource-rich, and shelter"?

#### Step 2: Recapitulation (Mirroring)
Summarize the description back to the text using **only the text's exact words**. Do not substitute your own vocabulary.

*   **Script:** "So, in this text, the Forest is described as [insert exact adjectives] and it makes the characters feel [insert exact emotion]. Have I got that right?"
*   **Purpose:** This confirms you have captured the specific "tone" and emphasis of the corpus without contamination from your own biases.

#### Step 3: Bridging (Contextualization)
Connect the image to the broader reality or argument of the text. This is the equivalent of asking a dreamer, "Is there anything in your life that is like this?".

*   **The Bridge Question:** "Is there any situation, argument, or theme in this text that is **like** [repeat Recapitulation]?"
*   **Example:** "Is there a political situation in Corpus A that is 'dark, ancient, and suffocating'?"
*   **Outcome:** This step moves you from the literal image to the *functional metaphor* unique to that corpus.

### Phase 3: The Comparison (Building the Dream Bridge)
Once you have completed the Description, Recapitulation, and Bridge for both corpora, you can cross the "Dream Bridge" to compare them.

**Compare the Adjectives and Feelings:**
*   In the DIM, the specific descriptors (adjectives) are the keys to meaning.
*   *Analysis:* Even if both texts use the metaphor of a "Mother," Corpus A might define her as "smothering and heavy" (Bridge: An intrusive government), while Corpus B defines her as "distant and reverent" (Bridge: An idealized past).

**Compare the Bridges:**
*   Look at what "waking life" situations the images bridge to.
*   *Analysis:* Does the "Storm" in Corpus A bridge to an internal emotional state (Feelings), while the "Storm" in Corpus B bridges to an external political event (Action/Plot)?.

### Key Principles for the Analyst

1.  **Use the Word "Like":** The most powerful tool in your kit is the question, "What is X **like**?" This simple addition triggers metaphorical thinking rather than dictionary definitions.
2.  **Focus on Feelings:** Always ask, "How does it feel to be in this place/situation?" Metaphors are often vehicles for specific emotions (anxiety, relief, frustration) that define their meaning.
3.  **Resist Interpretation:** Do not assume you know what the metaphor means until you have done the interview. "The Interpreter’s intrusion... commits the crime of stealing the thrill of discovery." Let the text reveal its own connections.
4.  **Day Notes as Context:** Just as a dreamer uses "Day Notes" (events from the day before the dream) to contextualize images, use the historical or literary context of the corpus to verify your bridges.

### Summary Checklist (The Flow Sheet)
1.  **Identify** the parallel metaphor.
2.  **Describe** it from the Martian POV (Corpus A).
3.  **Recapitulate** using exact words.
4.  **Bridge** to the text's context.
5.  **Repeat** for Corpus B.
6.  **Contrast** the specific descriptions and bridges to find the divergence in meaning.
