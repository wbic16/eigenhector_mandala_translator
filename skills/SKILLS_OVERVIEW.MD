# Skills Overview: Agent Capabilities

This document provides a high-level overview of the skills and tools available for agents within the `eigenhector_mandala_translator` repository. These capabilities are designed to facilitate the collection, analysis, and comparison of mystic text corpora.

## The Pipeline

The system follows a structured pipeline for processing mystical texts:

1.  **Fetching**: Acquiring text content from online sources (e.g., Substack).
2.  **Structuring**: Organizing fetched content into a standardized local file hierarchy.
3.  **Analyzing**: Extracting metaphors, themes, and structural dimensions from the corpus.
4.  **Bridging**: Comparing metaphors across different corpora using the Dream Interview Method (DIM).

## 1. Corpus Management Skills

These skills handle the initial acquisition and organization of data.

*   **[Adding Corpus Users](ADD_CORPUS_USER.MD)**: How to register user aliases and source URLs in the registry.
*   **[Listing Corpus Users](LIST_CORPUS_USERS.MD)**: Procedure for viewing all registered users and their sources.
*   **[Corpus Fetching](CORPUS_FETCHING.MD)**: Instructions for downloading content using the fetching tools.
*   **[Corpus Structure](CORPUS_STRUCTURE.MD)**: Defines the directory hierarchy (`index.json` and `docs/`) used for storage.

## 2. Analysis Skills

These skills focus on extracting meaningful insights from a single corpus.

*   **[Corpus Analysis](CORPUS_ANALYSIS.MD)**: Guidelines for identifying recurring metaphors, emotional textures, and structural dimensions.
*   **[Analysis JSON Template](ANALYSIS_JSON_TEMPLATE.json)**: The machine-readable schema for analysis output, required for downstream bridging.

## 3. Comparison Skills (The Dream Bridge)

These skills enable the comparison of different mystical perspectives.

*   **[Dream Interview Method (DIM)](DreamBridge/DIM.MD)**: The core methodology for interpreting metaphors as "dream images" using a Martian perspective.
*   **[Dream Bridge Template](ARI_DREAM_BRIDGE_TEMPLATE.MD)**: A structured template for documenting the comparison and synthesis of two parallel corpora.
*   **[Chiral Mirror Dialogue](CHIRAL_MIRROR_BOHMIAN_THANGKA.MD)**: A skill for simulating Bohmian dialogues through a chiral mirror to bridge mandalas.

## Supporting Tools

The following Python tools support the execution of these skills:

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `fetch_corpus.py` | Downloads content and converts it to structured Markdown files. |
| `list_users.py` | Displays the current corpus registry. |
| `verify_corpus.py` | Validates the integrity and completeness of a fetched corpus. |
| `validate_analysis_json.py` | Ensures analysis results strictly follow the required JSON schema. |
