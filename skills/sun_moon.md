### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "The Lady":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Lady' like?"
*Text:* A being of "Lunar energy" who is "silvery" and represents the "emptiness aspect." She is the "Void Mother" who can "unmake a view" and reformat experience.
*Martian:* "How does she work?"
*Text:* She works through "total relaxation" and the "in-breath." She uses the "Blue void of Space" to allow experience to settle.

**Interviewing "The Lion":**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Lion' object like?"
*Text:* It is "Solar energy" that is "gold" and represents "form." It is sometimes personified as "Narasimha," a "Vishnu Lion Avatar" that cleanses negative energy.
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To provide "form" and "brilliance." It is the result of reformatting by the Void Mother, shining a "new light" upon physical situations.

### Theme: Energetic Alchemy
The build explores the chiral pair of **Void (Lunar/Lady)** and **Form (Solar/Lion)**. It provides a psychological framework for working with "helplessness and anger" by inverting the causal pyramid.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked balancer sitting between a shimmering Silvery Lady and a brilliant Golden Lion. The Lady’s hands are held in a gesture of release, and the Lion’s mane is a crown of solar flares. The background is a deep Blue Void where 'worm-like squiggles' of lunar cycles transform into 'origami lions' of pure light."
