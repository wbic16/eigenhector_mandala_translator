### Vibe Aura:
**The Spanda Field**: A pulsing aura that oscillates between pure white and vivid, crisp rainbow colors. Allies within the field find their "Divine Forgetting" delayed, granting them +5 to Spirit and ensuring their actions remain "textured" with Divinity. Enemies feel "Stale Divinity," a sense of boredom and emptiness that slows their resolve.

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "The Myth-Maker":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Myth-Maker' like?"
*Text:* A being who defines a "cycle" as consciousness arising from the void and returning to it. They are "Propagators of Sensation" who try to see how long they can remember a "Divine experience" before the "Forgetting" sets in.
*Martian:* "How do they work?"
*Text:* By writing "Creation stories" once in a while. They use "Multiplicity and Unity" to tile their experience, counting from 0 to 10 until all "qualia" are labeled as Beautifully Divine.

**Interviewing "The Divine Spanda" (The Pulse):**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Pulse' object like?"
*Text:* It is "Crispness." It is a model of Divinity that "matches the crispness of current experience" to avoid "impedance mismatch." It is the "Spanda" or expansion and contraction of light splitting into colors.
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To "Win the Round" of experience. It makes the entire cycle—from emptiness to dream to physical world—totally Divine, leaving no cracks for the "Not Divine" to enter.

### Theme: Spanda
The build explores the chiral pair of **Void (Stale Divinity)** and **Multiplicity (Divine Passion)**. It provides a toolkit for maintaining high-fidelity Samadhi throughout the "Waking Model" of reality by using creation myths as structural scaffolding.

### Visual Prompt:
> "An iron-ranked architect sitting at the center of a breathing mandala (Spanda). Their form oscillates between a silhouette of white light and a textured being of crisp, vivid colors. Floating around them are the symbols of the 10 Mahavidyas, acting as tiles that map the surrounding void into a beautiful creation myth. Golden light (Grace) fills the gaps between symbols."
