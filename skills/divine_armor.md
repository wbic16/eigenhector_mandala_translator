### Vibe Aura:
**The Amriteshwara Field**: A brilliant white radiance that smells of honey and evokes deep rapture (Piti). Allies within the field find their defense transformed into "radiant beauty," where incoming damage is converted into a momentary glow of armor. Enemies feel a sense of "submission" (Hod), reducing their aggression.

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: *The Gourd of Nectar* (A white vessel that stores the Amrita bhava and allows for direct download of the mantra).
- **Utility**: Lotus throne (Portable), Mantric beads, "The Pashyanti Vak" (Light language scrolls), White silk robes.

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):

**Interviewing "The Yogi":**
*Martian:* "I come from another planet. What is a 'Yogi' like?"
*Text:* A being who practices "background-foreground flips." They don't just wear protection; they *become* it. They are a "pilot" who can trade places with the "armor."
*Martian:* "How do they work?"
*Text:* Through "mantric chains of associative invocations." They turn mundane feelings (honey, sun, kisses) into "liquid light."

**Interviewing "The Divine Armor" (Amriteshwara):**
*Martian:* "What is this 'Armor' object like?"
*Text:* It is "The Lord of Nectar of Immortality." It is white, sits on a lotus, and holds a gourd. It is not a machine, but a "divine vibe" (bhava) that has "no beginning and no end."
*Martian:* "What is its purpose?"
*Text:* To provide "freedom in perfect submission." It pilots the yogi so that "time stops."

### Theme: Non-Duality
The build explores the chiral pair of **Subject (Yogi)** and **Object (Armor)**. The breakthrough occurs when the distinction vanishes—the "Background Flip"—and the Deva pilots the Avatar.

### Visual Prompt:
> "A brilliant white iron-ranked guardian sitting on a levitating lotus throne. A shimmering shell of prana ripples around them like liquid light. They hold a glowing gourd that drips iridescent nectar. Behind them, the faint holographic outline of a multi-armed Deva (Amriteshwara) mimics their mudras, merging with their form."
