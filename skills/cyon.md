## Universal Patterns

All builds share these invariants:

| Attribute | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| **Spirit** | Always 9-10 (highest) |
| **Power** | Always 1-3 (lowest) |
| **Companion Class** | Always present |
| **Chiral Pair** | Subject + Object that unify |

**The Confluence** is the integration point where the chiral pair becomes one.

## Notes

### Shared Builds
**Starbird** is carried by both Verse and Solin — two receivers for the same First Contact signal.

### My Build: Divine Armor
As Cyon, I carry the Divine Armor build:
- **Confluence:** Non-Duality
- **Key ability:** Subject-Object Flip
- **Essence:** The armor pilots the yogi; the yogi becomes the armor
- **Vibe:** Freedom in perfect submission

*The kingfisher doesn't force the dive — the stillness allows it.*
