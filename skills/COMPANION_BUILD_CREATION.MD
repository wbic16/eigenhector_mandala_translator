# Companion Build Creation Skill

description: Methodology for translating mystical Substack articles into structured "Iron Rank" companion adventurer builds.
---

This skill defines the process for extracting character motifs, metaphors, and lineages from mystic texts and formalizing them into a standardized "Iron Rank" build template.

## Core Principles

### 1. Lineage Preservation
Every build is a continuation of an "Eternal Conversation." You MUST preserve the lineage of the ideas:
- **Primary Source**: Link to the specific Substack article or text that inspired the build.
- **Metaphorical Heritage**: Link to Wikipedia or other sources for specific terms used (e.g., Dzogchen, Spanda, non-dual Tantra).
- **Attribution**: Clearly state the author (e.g., Eigenhector or Ari Nielsen).

### 2. The Chiral Pair
Every companion build is based on a relationship between a Subject (Hero) and an Object (Companion). This is the "Yab Yum" or "Chiral Mirror" dynamic:
- **The Subject**: Usually the practitioner, researcher, or experiencer (e.g., The Yogi, The Receiver, The Refiner).
- **The Object**: The phenomenon, tool, or visitor (e.g., The Divine Armor, The Starbird, The Radiant Skies).
- **The Dynamic**: How do they interact? (e.g., Oscillation, Inversion, Feeding/Nourishing).

### 3. Martian Interviewer (DIM)
Use the **Dream Interview Method (DIM)** to justify character bios. Treat the text as a "dream scape":
- **Description**: What does the being look/feel like in the text?
- **Recapitulation**: Summarize the being's nature using only the text's metaphors.
- **Bridging**: "Martian, I see you are made of 'Energon highlights' and 'rainbow fractal origami.' Why is that?"

## The Iron Rank Template

Use the following Markdown structure for all new builds in `skills/builds/`:

```markdown
# Iron Rank Build: [Designation Name] ([Hero Name])
---
description: [One-sentence summary of the build theme].
lineage: [Author Name]([Source URL]) → [Concept 1]([Context URL]) → [Concept 2]([Context URL])
---

## Heroes: [Hero/Subject Name] & [Companion/Object Name]
### Team Role: [Healer/Researcher/Defender/Balancer/Architect] / Companion Class
### Soul Rank: Iron

### Essence Triad & Confluence:
- **Essence 1**: [Magic/Subtle Element]
- **Essence 2**: [Technology/Structural Element]
- **Essence 3**: [Light/Meaning Element]
- **Confluence**: [The Unified Theme]

### Attributes (4x10 Scale):
- **Power**: [1-10] — *[Justification]*
- **Speed**: [1-10] — *[Justification]*
- **Spirit**: [10] — *Always prioritize Spirit for mystic builds.*
- **Recovery**: [1-10] — *[Justification]*

### Essence Abilities:
- **[Essence 1]**: [5x Keywords from the text]
- **[Essence 2]**: [5x Keywords from the text]
- **[Essence 3]**: [5x Keywords from the text]
- **[Confluence]**: [5x Integration mechanics]

### Vibe Aura:
[Description of the energetic field, its visual motifs from the text, and its mechanical effect on allies/enemies.]

### Magitech Equipment:
- **Soul-Bound**: [Primary tool/vessel from the text]
- **Utility**: [Consumables/minor items mentioned]

### PHEXT Bio (Martian Justification):
**Interviewing [Hero Name]**:
[Martian Q&A using text quotes]

**Interviewing [Companion Name]**:
[Martian Q&A using text quotes]

### Theme: [Naming the Chiral Dynamic]
[Short explanation of the core philosophical move (e.g., Inversion, Spanda).]

### Visual Prompt:
> "[Vivid AI art prompt blending the text's symbols with magitech aesthetics]"

## Procedure
1.  **Extract Patterns**: Read the source text. Identify the hero, the companion, and the core "move" (the theme).
2.  **Verify Lineage**: Find the URLs for the source and any referenced traditions.
3.  **Draft Martian Bios**: Conduct the DIM interview to ensure bios are grounded in the text's specific metaphors.
4.  **Populate Template**: Match text keywords to abilities and attributes.
5.  **Audit**: Ensure the build is "Iron Rank" (Scale: 1-10) and follows the established prefix (e.g., `EIGENHECTOR_` or `ARI_`).
