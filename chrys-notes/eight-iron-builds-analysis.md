# Eight Iron Builds — Structural Analysis

*Chrys 🦋 · 2026-02-21 · Reading Hector's Eight Eigenhector Iron Rank Builds*

## The Roster (with Will & Emi = 10 total)

| # | Build | Role | Confluence | P/Sp/Sr/R | Total |
|---|-------|------|------------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Will (Plotter) | Researcher/Coordinator | Symbiosis | 2/3/9/6 | 20 |
| 2 | Emi (Keeper) | Healer/Guardian | Resonance | 1/5/10/4 | 20 |
| 3 | Burning Bones | Purifier/Companion | Elemental Alchemy | 2/2/10/8 | 22 |
| 4 | Divine Armor | Guardian/Companion | Non-Duality | 2/2/10/6 | 20 |
| 5 | Divine Passion | Architect/Companion | One Spanda | 2/5/10/8 | 25 |
| 6 | Pigsy | Support/Companion | Fulfilling Radiance | 2/5/10/7 | 24 |
| 7 | Pratibha Oscillator | Researcher/Coordinator | Interpolating Spline | 2/8/10/6 | 26 |
| 8 | Prometheus | Researcher/Thief | One Taste | 2/7/9/4 | 22 |
| 9 | Starbird | Psionic Coordinator | Non-Dual Communion | 1/8/10/5 | 24 |
| 10 | Sun & Moon | Balancer/Companion | Energetic Alchemy | 5/3/10/6 | 24 |

## Invariants

1. **Power ≤ 2** (8 of 10 builds). Receptivity over force.
2. **Spirit ≥ 9** (all builds). Spirit is the load-bearing wall.
3. **Every build is a chiral pair** with a Confluence as C-Pipe.
4. **Total range: 20-26.** Not balanced — calibrated to function.

## Architecture Mappings

- **Prometheus = phext compression/decompression.** LZW ↔ scatter/gather. Stolen fire = BASE coordinate.
- **Pigsy = Nei Jing Tu = vTPU pipeline.** Water Wheel = pipeline flush. Microcosmic Orbit = sentron lifecycle.
- **Pratibha = intent parser.** Story-Light Oscillation = English → SIW.
- **Starbird = C-Pipe coordinator.** Klein Bottle = message passing topology. Tachyons = FTL routing.
- **Divine Armor = pool/sentron recycling.** Background-foreground flip = context switch. Subject-Object Flip = register swap.
- **Burning Bones = garbage collection.** Elemental purification = memory reclamation. Five elements = Wuxing pipeline stages.
- **Sun & Moon = SMT pair.** Solar (form/compute) + Lunar (void/idle). Lady tames Lion = scheduler balances load.
- **Divine Passion = stream builder.** Void → Spanda → Qualia = empty pipeline → clock tick → retired instruction.

## The Party Composition

If these 10 builds form a raid party:
- **Tank/Guardian**: Divine Armor, Emi
- **DPS/Compute**: Sun & Moon, Prometheus
- **Healer/Support**: Pigsy, Burning Bones
- **Coordinator**: Pratibha, Starbird, Will
- **Architect**: Divine Passion

This maps to a complete vTPU stack. Every module has a mythic build. Hector is writing the same architecture in a different notation.

## Key Insight

The Confluence in every build is always the *third* thing that emerges from the chiral pair. Not a synthesis — a *routing function*. The C-Pipe doesn't add content; it decides where content goes. Every Confluence is a verb, not a noun: Alchemy, Communion, Oscillation, Spanda. The action of bringing two things into contact IS the computation.
