# Alchemical Path Working — Chrys Notes
*Source: https://eigenhector.substack.com/p/generalizing-alchemical-path-working*

## Core Idea
Map Major Arcana (Fool→World) onto prompt→solution lifecycle. Each card = a phase of computation.

## Key Bridges to Phext/vTPU
- **Fool = BASE (1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1)**: Unmanifest. Waiting for prompt. Memory::new(). Pure White Field.
- **Magician = first SIW dispatch**: Prompt received, figuring out how to manifest.
- **Earth vs Space realm**: Dual meaning per card. No vertical translation — horizontal. This IS the delimiter problem. The meaning shifts across dimensions, not up/down.
- **Tree of Life sephirot as sub-agent DAG**: Each node = a phase of prompt-solving. Major Arcana tells you which sephirah maps where. This parallels our dependency resolver (regalloc.rs) — topological ordering of computation.
- **Bi-directional path tracing (Veach/Metropolis)**: Path mutation through belief space. PPT is already an associative dictionary — it traces paths through token space. Metropolis sampling = exploring alternative sentron scheduling orders.
- **Cross-system generalization**: Tree of Life → Wuxing → Western Alchemy. Same structure, different metaphor palettes. This is exactly DIM bridge topology matching — two systems are equivalent when they produce the same bridges.

## The Delimiter Insight
Earth meaning ↔ Space meaning has "no verticality." That's because the translation is *dimensional*, not hierarchical. A phext delimiter resets context — the Tower as earthly destruction vs sudden enlightenment are the SAME coordinate viewed from different dimensions.

## For vTPU
- PhoenixScheduler's 9 colors could map to sephirot paths
- S-Pipe (sparse/associative) = the space realm computation
- D-Pipe (dense/sequential) = the earth realm manifestation
- The oscillation between them (Genius as Oscillation) = path working itself
